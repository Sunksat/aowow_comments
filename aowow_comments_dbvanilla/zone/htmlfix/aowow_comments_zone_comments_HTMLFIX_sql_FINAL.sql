There\'s still that portal from Eastern Plaguelands into Ghostlands.  Unless you use the translocation orb from Undercity, you\'ll have to go through that portal.  They didn\'t want players who hadn\'t purchased Burning Crusade to be able to access the lands.  This was changed in Cataclysm, thus abandoning portals for all new zones in Azeroth.\n\nAlso, another reason why: I believe Ghostlands and Eversong Woods are technically not part of the same map as the rest of Eastern Kalimdor.  Going through the portal has the same effect as taking a boat/zep across continents; It transports you to a different map.

It\'s the only true "haunted house" in Warcraft. Combine the magnitude of the scenery with the characters involved (Moroes FTW) with the events that occur (the opera, the dinner, chess) and also with the music that plays in the background and you have yourself one helluva raid. While it is easy to get lost in this place, even getting lost is worth it since you get to see things you would never find in another instance. Not to mention, the entire instance is floating between two dimensions - the real world, where it exists in Deadwind, and some form of the Twisting Nether, where the tower itself is shattered to pieces.\n\nThe boss fights, due to the fact that it is a level 70 10m and has been greatly nerfed, are cake. The only events that gave us remote trouble were Netherspite (the portal phase can get a tad bit confusing but chances are you\'ll have the boss dead before it gets out of hand) and the Chess Event (mainly due to the fact that it was created for 10 players). Still, I eventually managed to two-man the Chess Event through a mixture of luck and frantic piece changing, and all that was left was the Prince, who isn\'t much trouble at all if you tank him in the doorway, where infernals don\'t spawn.\n\nOverall, an outstanding piece of work by Blizzard. Unfortunately, the uniqueness of the raid is hard to recreate without exactly copying aspects of it (primarily, the whole idea of a "haunted house" being a raid was genious), but if you haven\'t run it before then grab a few 80 friends and go for it. I wouldn\'t pug it or anything because the last thing you want is to be stuck with people who care so much about the achievement that they don\'t enjoy the raid and ragequit if you get lost or lose the chess event.\n\nPossibly the nerdiest post I\'ve ever created, but I feel justified in doing so.',1065585,0,'0',0);

My gear consists of epics ilvl 219-226, with a few 200 and a few 245.\n\nThe trick to making it easy is to NOT spec full protection. Full protection is an awful spec for soloing, because it\'s completely unsustainable. Once your health drops down, you only have a few one-trick ponies such as LoH, Argent Defender, a healing potion, and the almost-not-worth it Divine Shield and blowing your entire mana bar on healing yourself for 10k. After those are blown, you\'re slowly dying with no way to heal yourself.\n\nhttp://DBURLHERE/?talent#sZA0xA0uMZvfMx0IzhdI0s:0ibmc 0/27/44  is much, much better. It goes down in ret in order to pick up AoW, JotW and Sheath of Light, which together give you the precious insta-cast FoL\'s that heal for a decent amount. Furthermore, I pick up Crusader Strike and all the +crit talents, as it\'s vital to be able to get those AoW procs.\n\nGear is basically as ret - full str, crit, etc. Don\'t equip tank gear as you\'ll lose much needed crit rating. The beauty of this build is that you can swap out the following, depending on how defensive or offensive you need to be:\n\nWeapon: Sword (as low delay as possible, for more crits) +Shield for defense, 2H for offense.\nBlessing: BoSanct for defense, BoM for offense.\nSeal: Seal of Light for defense, SoV for offense.\n\nFor the majority of fights, go "defensive mode" to make it a breeze. Remember to buff talented Righteous Fury, and on tough fights, it\'s simply a matter of discipline - every time your health dips below 90%, use an insta-cast FoL.\n\nThe toughest guy in there was definitely the Opera event, with the Wizard of Oz. That event is pretty much impossible as 51 ret with 2H, so it forced me to research a new spec. With this build though, I was in complete control and didn\'t even use LoH. Second toughest was Prince, but even he wasn\'t very tough. Chess is annoying since it\'s a matter of being lucky.\n\nA little rundown of the bosses:\n\n* Attumen: Easy, tank and spank.\n\n* Moroes: http://DBURLHERE/?spell=10326 Turn Evil  the shadow priest (http://DBURLHERE/?npc=19875 Baroness Dorothea Millstipe ) if she\'s up - and keep her feared, otherwise her mana burn will take a huge chunk of your mana. If she\'s not up, fear the annoying paladin (http://DBURLHERE/?npc=17007 Lady Keira Berrybuck ) or whoever is giving you the most trouble. Watch where she goes, and every time she returns to you, throw a new fear on her. Otherwise, just go to town on the adds and kill Moroes himself afterwards.\n\n* Maiden: Easy, walk up and kill her. Did her as retribution.\n\n* Opera Event: As mentioned, a tough one.\n\n- Wiz of Oz: Use Frost Aura, and kill Dorothee first. Open up on Dorothee with SoV and AW to burn her while the other mobs are still inactive. After about 15-20 seconds, switch to SoL. Kill her, then Roar, then the rest are easy. Crone is easy. An overall tough fight until Dorothee is down.\n- The Big Bad Wolf: I used my hybrid spec for him, but I think full ret might be a bit faster. Every time he LRRH\'s you, ruuuuuun like a headless chicken around the stage. When it runs out, dps him and top yourself off, along with a fresh Sacred Shield. Also a tough fight.\n- Romulo and Julianne - probably impossible to solo :(. This forces you to wait for a reset and try again. Bummer.\n\n* Curator: Also very easy, kill sparks as they appear. When he evocates (+200% damage taken); switch to 2H and burn him down while he has the debuff to speed things up a bit.\n\n* Chess Event: I got lucky and somehow the other team\'s king got down to 50% somehow, without be controlling any pieces to damage him. I took control of my king and burned him donw. Took 4 tries one time, 1 try another time. A good tip is to move the conjurer forward a bit so you can nuke the other team\'s king with him, then when their king is down to around 50%, move ahead with your king and bash him down.\n\n* Illhoof: The "Legacy of the Mountain King" book from the tomes is extremely good here, as it has a chance to proc +100 to all resists, and stacks twice. Ignore all the imps, put on fire resistance aura and coupled with the resist proc from the book, you\'ll take virtually no damage.\n\n* Shade of Aran: Full retribution spec for this guy. Super easy, just burn him down. You can put on a resistance aura, either frost or fire helps a little. When the water elementals pop, use Divine Shield so they come to you, then kill them.\n\n* Netherspite: Pull him out of his room (you can just make it with a 30-yard range spell) before the door closes, and he\'ll come for you. Fight him in the room just outside and burn him down. He still empowers (+200% damage), which makes him hit pretty hard, but doesn\'t get the beams when he isn\'t in his room, so you just have the Netherbreath (often resisted) and void zones to worry about.\n\n* Nightbane: Easy, just takes a long time. Beware that you don\'t pull him too far down the balcony, he bugged out on me once and just flew away.\n\n* Prince. A bit tough. He hits pretty hard in phase 2 and 3, but as long as you constantly keep your health up, and move out of the hellfire from demons (or get lucky and dont\' have to move much), its not bad.\n\nGood luck to other soloers! :)',891749,0,'0',0);

Took just over an hour. \n\n[b]Notes[/b]: I sustained around 9.5k DPS on most of the fights. The exception where I was lower than that was Aran, where I had to put on Frost Resist gear and spend a decent amount of energy on Kick which brought that down to about 7.5k.\n\n[i]Consumables used[/i]: Flask of Endless Rage, Runic Healing Injector, Indestructible Potion (as a prepot on physical damage bosses), Runescroll of Fortitude, Drums of Forgotten Kings.\n\n[i]Unbuffed stats[/i]: 33954 health, 13658 armor, 52.99% dodge, 6533 AP, 1068 Haste, 651 hit, 746 crit, 200 expertise. 2457 Agility, 2653 Stamina.\n\n[i]Talents[/i]: Improved Recuperate and Reinforced Leather are a must. Aside from that, I used a standard raiding spec.\n\n[i]Glyphs[/i]: Use Major Glyphs of Blade Flurry, Feint, and Sprint, though Cloak of Shadows and Evasion are also options if you\'re having trouble with physical damage killing you. Prime Glyphs should be Sinister Strike, Adrenaline Rush, and Slice and Dice optimally; Killing Spree is an option over Slice and Dice for burst fights like Aran.\n\n[i]Enchants[/i]: I used optimal raiding enchants. Nearly every piece of gear was reforged, dropping crit in favor of haste or hit.\n\n[i]Method[/i]: Recuperate is your best friend. It\'s more important than Slice and Dice for this. Injectors should be used when you\'re down roughly the amount of health it will restore. Evasion, when not noted, is used to catch up on healing. DPS cooldowns should be burned when they will yield the highest increase in damage unless otherwise noted.\n\n[b]Boss Rundowns[/b]\n[i]Attumen[/i]: This one\'s pretty simple. Clear out the trash and burn him. Cloak of Shadows the -hit debuff if you get it, and Dismantle Attumen to reduce incoming damage.\n\n[i[Moroes[/i]: Pull from behind so as to avoid socially aggroing trash, and pop Blade Flurry and Killing Spree off the start. Evasioning early while the adds are still up is also a good idea. When Moroes Vanishes (if he lives that long), take that opportunity to burn the remaining adds.\n\n[i]Maiden of Virtue[/i]: Hit her. She dies. Kinda like Attumen. Feint on Cooldown if you have it glyphed, but it\'s not a big deal really.\n\n[b][i]Opera Event[/i][/b]: \n[i]Oz[/i]: I haven\'t gotten this one since 4.0.1, but pre-patch it was a simple priority of who to burn down. Dorothy is obviously first because of the Frostbolt spam, followed by the Lion to remove his fear. Beyond that, it\'s a fairly simple ordeal to finish off the fight.\n\n[i]Romulo and Jullianne[/i]: Make sure to kick all of Julianne\'s Eternal Affection casts. Save all cooldowns (Evasion, Adrenaline Rush, Killing Spree, and Blade Flurry) for phase 3, as it\'s the only one where you\'ll really take damage. After burning both down solo, Blade Flurry and Killing Spree to open in phase 3, following Killing Spree with Adrenaline Rush. Alternatively you can BF and AR, while saving KS for finishing the second one off in event one of them dies much faster than the other. Continue to kick Eternal Affection, and Cloak when possible to mitigate some of Julianne\'s outgoing damage.\n\n[i]Big Bad Wolf[/i]: Again, I haven\'t gotten this one since 4.0.1, but I was unable to solo it before the patch as well. I\'ll update with information when I get this encounter.\n\n[i]Nightbane[/i]: Glyph of Feint and Feinting on cooldown is a big help. Don\'t stand in Charred Earth. Right before the air phases (75%, 50%, and 25%), refresh Recuperate and get 4-5 CPs back up on him. Refresh Recuperate with these points when the adds begin spawning. Blade Flurry the adds, and refresh Recuperate if it gets low, 1-2 points is fine. Use Evasion during ground phases to play catch up on healing if he gets you down to about 50%.\n\n[i]Curator[/i]: I\'ll be honest, I pulled him by accident this week. I learned from that, though, that you can stealth by and pull him from behind while he\'s on the ramp without also getting any trash. Save Evasion for his hard enrage at 15%. Use cooldowns to burn him, and Blade Flurry the sparks. Rarely should you have to target swap to kill a spark. Cloak when available (preferably while a spark is up). This fight gets close, mostly because of the Arcane Bolt.\n\n[i]Illhoof[/i]: Again, heavy magic damage causes problems here. Not as bad as Aran, but your health will still dip lower than most of the other fights. Open with Blade Flurry to take down his Imp and get the increased damage on him, then burn his health with cooldowns. Take out the little Imps from time to time with a few Fans of Knives.\n\n[i]Aran[/i]: This is the big guy, the hardest fight in the instance for us. Glyph of Kick is pretty much required, as is 170+ Frost Resist. Kick anything you can that\'s not a Frostbolt, first of all. Try to save Cloak for 40% when the adds spawn. Burn your AR around 50% so you can be ready to push him down ASAP. Get an Expose up before the adds spawn if you don\'t normally keep it up anyway. Keep him in the middle of the room to avoid bouncing to the adds and pop Killing Spree while continuing to burn him. Cloak a volley of Water Bolts from the adds, and Vanish another (if you Vanish and immediately attack Aran he will not reset). Pray he dies before the Water Bolts overwhelm you.\n\n[i]Netherspite[/i]: Little tricky with this one. Wait for him to patrol close to his door and pull him from range while sprinting out the door. I found, as an engineer, that throwing a Saronite Bomb worked best for this as the travel time gave me an extra moment or two before the door closed. Now, he will hit like a truck because of the Empowered buff. Feint on cooldown to reduce damage from his aura, as well as his breath during phase 2. It\'s largely a battle of surviving only until phase 2, at which point you put your back to a wall and burn him with everything you\'ve got. Cloak is exceptionally effective during phase 2.\n\nI\'m interested to see if this can be done without exploiting the fight, and that\'s something I\'ll experiment with in the coming weeks.\n\n[i]Chess Event[/i]: This was soloable at 70 by anyone, nothing new here. It may take a couple of tries to get the hang of if you\'ve never done it before. If you use an addon for buffs, also, have "/cancelaura Control Piece" ready to get out of pieces as you cannot click off buffs currently if using a third party buff frame.\n\n[i]Prince Malchezzar[/i]: This is actually far more simple than it seems. Move if an abyssal lands on you, obviously. Feint Shadow Novas, use AR and KS during phase two to burn him through it as quick as possible, and Evasion during phase 3. Save Cloak of Shadows for Amplify Damage.',1155456,0,'0',0);

If you have the ability to reset, then I would recommend doing that, as the mobs I mention below *do* reset with the instance. Just be sure to space your entrances out by 12 mins.\n\nI actually ran ?zone=3457">(Zone #3457)  for the first time (on any of my toons) the other day. I am a level 90 Arcane mage with a 483 iLevel. I also have the level 12 guild perk ?spell=78635">(Spell #78635)  along with the http://DBURLHERE/?item=64402">(Item #64402)  (?item=64399">(Item #64399)  for Alliance).\n[b]Note[/b]: Due to the "5 instance entrances per hour" cap, you need to spread out your entrances by 12 mins (which with this guide is very easy to do) I like to use the in-game stopwatch to make sure I am spacing my entrances out enough. \n\nWhen I rep grind I usually look for a renewable way of grinding the rep in dungeons and raids. However I was running Kara with a guildmate so we ended up doing a full clear. I did also end up doing all of the quests outside of the raid entrance and completed as many as I could (until I am able to run Kara again and finish the rest). I did notice something, though, as I was doing the quests. As soon as you enter Kara (and go through the door) turn to the right, in that room there is a spider, through the next rooms are more spiders, eventually you will get to an area with bats, and through there a room with dogs. [b]All of these mobs respawn every 30 mins[/b] (and yes I actually waited and can confirm it\'s every 30) Yes, I am now aware that there is another post on here that says that, but I am making this post to 1. Confirm this is true and 2. Describe my method to maximize rep grind. Note: I was also grinding this rep along with ?faction=990">(Faction #990)  (http://DBURLHERE/?faction=990#comments:id=1812798 which I have also written a detailed rep grinding guide ). I would do two runs of Scale of the Sands and then come and do one run of Violet Eye.\n\n[b]My Method[/b]:\n[b]Note[/b]: My route is important as it maximizes the number of mobs I grab in the shortest distance. I need to try to do it as fast as I can before my ?spell=33245">(Spell #33245)  falls off. Also, this is to confirm that trash mobs DO give rep through exalted.\n\nI would enter the raid and start my stopwatch. Go through the door and head into the spider room. I would throw up my ?spell=33245">(Spell #33245)  as I am a clothie and this, am squishy. and run by the first spider, aggroing him. Note, I never actually did any damage until the end when I being AOEing. Going into the next room I would grab the spider on the right, then the ones on the left. There is a patroling spider in the next room that will come up one of the two ramps, I would then run down the same ramp, aggroing him. I would then run to the right to grab the spider in the corner, then make my way across the room, grabbing the two spiders in the middle and the two in the far corner. I would then head into the bat room. I would grab the bats, then head to the right and grab the bats in the other half. There is a little alcove with bats in it, grab them (and remember this spot). Pull all of the spiders and bats into the doorway of the next room (with the dogs) and while in the doorway drop your http://DBURLHERE/?item=64402">(Item #64402)  (?item=64399">(Item #64399)  for Alliance) and begin to AOE. Dropping the banner here *is* important. once everything you\'ve already aggroed is dead begin to make your way through the room killing all of the dogs. Once you reach the end and have all of the mobs dead you\'re done..... OR ARE YOU?\n\n[b]Why I placed my banner where I did[/b]:\nI\'m not exactally sure why this happens, either it\'s how fast you kill the mobs, or where you kill them, or it may actually happen every time and no one has noticed. But once you are done, a rare will spawn. One of three rares will spawn (either a bat, a spider, or a dog). The bat rare http://DBURLHERE/?npc=16180">(NPC #16180)  spawns in the little alcove just off the bat room (the one I said to remember). The spider rare http://DBURLHERE/?npc=16179">(NPC #16179)  spawns in the previous spider room in the corner (next to where you came into the bat room). If you get the spider rare, walk over there slowly and only go as far as you need to to kill him, you do this to stay in range of your battle standard. I have yet to have the dog rare http://DBURLHERE/?npc=16181">(NPC #16181)  spawn and I\'ve done this about 15 times (EDIT: The 2nd run after I posted this, I got the dog. he spawns at the end of the room, opposite the entrance, where all the other dogs are).

The events that you participate in at an earlier part of the game are considered "earlier" in the game time line.\n\nJust because you can do the quests in Northshire Abby at level 70 (if you\'re not human, usually) and quests in Netherstorm minutes later (or before) does not mean both occured at the exact same time.\n\nSince it is an open world environment with people of all levels interacting together some level of imagination needs to be maintained. Blizzard expects us to do this for our own sake and theirs.\n\nJust because Arthas is in Ebon Hold at the same time he\'s in some end-game dungeon doesn\'t mean that according to the progression of the game\'s time line is he in both places at once.\n\nIt is assumed that these events occurred either before or after other events and that multiple instances of the same character are reflecting different points in the time line. Which you as a player can observe, but technically, your character doesn\'t.\n\nIts at this point where some people have broken down the game so much that they have totally demolished the intended story experience. Stop thinking so much and just go with it. Its fantasy and its a story. Even if you\'re not an RPer on an RP realm you\'re playing a fantasy game. Its not all about checking reality and theorycrafting top potential DPS.\n\nAt some point you need to just take a step back and enjoy it as it is.\n\nEDIT: Just to amend my comment, this aspect of storytelling is called either "suspension of belief" or "willing suspension of disbelief".\n\nAccording to WikipediaSuspension of disbelief or "willing suspension of disbelief" is a formula for justifying the use of fantastic or non-realistic elements in literary works of fiction. It was put forth in English by the poet and aesthetic philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who suggested that if a writer could infuse a "human interest and a semblance of truth" into a fantastic tale, the reader would suspend judgment concerning the implausibility of the narrative. Suspension of disbelief often applies to fictional works of the action, comedy, science fiction, and horror genres. Cognitive estrangement in fiction involves using a person\'s ignorance or lack of knowledge to promote suspension of disbelief.\n\nThe phrase "suspension of disbelief" came to be used more loosely in the later 20th century, often used to imply that the onus was on the reader, rather than the writer, to achieve it. It might be used to refer to the willingness of the audience to overlook the limitations of a medium, so that these do not interfere with the acceptance of those premises. These fictional premises may also lend to the engagement of the mind and perhaps proposition of thoughts, ideas, art and theoriesSource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_belief http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_belief ',415785,0,'0',0);

In most cases you won\'t be able to do anything for 16 seconds, including Rune Tap and other cooldowns, so it\'s crucial to be at full health when he casts it.\n\n[b]Patchwerk[/b]: Kill all leading up to Patchwerk as they\'ll attack you upon pulling the boss otherwise. After Razuvious, Patchwerk is the hardest-hitting boss in Naxx. Remember to use your cooldowns.\n\n[b]Gluth[/b]: Equip DPS gear for this one, as this boss does no significant damage.\nGluth often summons zombies that will run towards you. There is no way (at least, none I figured out yet) to deal with these adds while soloing, so ignore them and Gluth will eat them. Upon consuming a zombie, he will heal 5% of his total health. You\'ll need ~20K dps to get him down before his berserk timer.',1612367,0,'0',0);

The quests are easy, very stackable and the rewards are well worth the effort.  Ghostlands has its own reputation and reputation vendor in Tranquillien.  The reputation will get to Exalted if you do most of the quests in the zone.  The rewards are excellent for your level, including a blue +7 stamina cape.  These reputation rewards, other quest rewards, and the incidental green drops offer the best rewards for any zone of its level in the game.  By the time I left I had full greens, two blue and 15+ gold.  This is a great pre-cursor to Wailing Caverns. \n\nIf you are looking to level as quickly as possible I would recommend leveling to 15 in Ghostlands, then go to the Barrens and level to about 19 and then return to the Ghostlands to finish it up.  You will have access to loads of stackable quests and can cherry pick your rewards.  You can essentially make one big \'S\' in Ghostlands and do most of the quests.  Pick up the quests in Tranquillien and head to the Suncrown Village area, then head west to Goldenmist Village and then Windrunner Village.  You can then head east to the Farstrider Enclave and eventually head to Deatholme with a group.   \n\nSome notable quests: \n\n20 [14] Into Occupied Territory - This quest is bugged at the time of this writing.  The Night Elves do not leave the ship making it hard to solo.  Bring a group to be safe or expect a prolonged effort to complete it.\n\n26 &amp; 23 [17] Spinal Dust and Rotting Hearts - Repeatable quests for some good undead slaying potions.  If you?re looking to grind at this level these mobs are ideal since they give you these item which can be used later in the game versus undead.  It may be worth saving one or two for when you head into Deatholme.\n\n32 [11] Anok\'suten - Even though he is elite, he is quite soloable.  Kill off a few of the other spiders in his patrol route.  Anyone with range can sit on a building and pelt him while be comes up to get you.  Simply jump down to the lower level and pelt him again when he is near.  Jump down on the ground when he is near again. \n\n42 [16] The Traitor\'s Shadow - This is the start of the main quest chain. \n\n45 [17] A Little Dash of Seasoning - Do this while doing the other Troll quests in Zeb\'Nowa.  The racks are both outside and inside some of the huts.\n\n48 [20] Bring me the Kel\'Gash\'s Head! - Although he is a 20 elite, he is doable solo using the same method above (Anok\'suten).\n\n52 [18] War on Deatholme - Do this prior to taking a group to Deatholme since it chains to another quest in Deatholme (Captives at Deatholme).\n\n54 [21] The Traitor\'s Destruction - You will definitely need a group for this one, but the rewards are well worth the effort.\n\n58 [16] Escape from the Catacombs - This can be difficult to solo because of the fast respawn rate and the number of Trolls in the area.  Best to take a group.\n\n60 [16] The Lady\'s Necklace - Is a drop from the mobs in the area.  The quest chain does not lead up to anything good and you should only complete it in the Undercity if you are going there anyhow. \n\nAfter Ghostlands I would recommend heading to the Barrens to fill out a few levels and/or do Wailing Caverns.',8935,0,'0',0);

All of the quests are soloable and most of them are fairly easy to accomplish.  The quests are fairly linear and offer clear choices of where to head to next.  A lot of the mobs are particularly easy for casters since they have low hit points and have some drops that boost your mana.  In this regard they can fun to grind since you can accumulate a fair amount of mana boosting drops.  \n\nSunstrider Island is an excellent starting area with fast respawning mobs that are easy to best.  You should be in no danger of dying and the only tricky part may be finding the Shrine of Dath\'Remar, which is in the Northwest of the island.  The Ruins of Silvermoon is another enclosed area for your starting quests that provide more of a challenge.  After the first few quests here you will leave the ruins and return to train so it is best to set your Hearthstone here for a little while.  When you begin to wander outside of the ruins you will in general head west and do those quests before going east towards Farstrider Retreat; traveling further south as you progress. \n\nSome notable quests: \n\n23 [6] Wanted: Thaelis the Hungerer - This is the quest from the wanted poster.  He will spawn randomly in several of the buildings in the ruins.  I have primarily seen him in the Northeast building in the ruins.\n\n32  [6] Roadside Ambush - This small chain of quests is easy and nets you a 4-slot container.  Simply talk to the NPC and follow his directions.\n\n40  [7] Fish heads, Fish heads - At the time of the beta the low drop rate can make this not really worth the time.  I eventually killed about 30+ Murlocs to get all of the heads. \n\n48  [9] The Ring of Mmmrrggll - It is best to clear out one of the Murloc villages and then tag him as he paths through it.  Otherwise it is very easy to get several adds since he runs fairly fast when low on health. \n\n58 [8] The Party Never Ends - This quest will incidentally get finished as you travel around doing your other quests.  Don\'t be in a rush with it or you will be doing a lot of pointless traveling.\n\n79 [8] Zul\'Marash - The quest giver is a Troll in the cage in the Tor\'watha village.  Zul\'Marash himself is quite easy since you can simply jump off the building if you get in trouble and tag him as he paths down to get you. \n\n81 [10] Powering Our Defenses - Probably the most difficult quest in the zone.  Expect three waves of mobs, between two or three mobs per wave.  Remember that you don\'t have to kill all of the mobs, just keep them off of the rune.  If you can kite them around a bit, it will make the encounter trivial.\n\n84 [10] The Fallen Courier - Be sure not to miss this one on your way to Ghostlands, it nets you a 6-slot bad and green bracers.',8945,0,'0',0);

I\'m farming Cenarion Circle rep for the Guardian of Cenarius title, which I think is an appropriate title for a Druid.  Balance is my secondary spec and I did it in my resto gear.  \n\nKurinnax was slightly annoying because I forgot about his stupid sand hill Silence gimmick and got silenced once.  That is a long silence.  Also there seemed to be something bugged, I kept trying to lead him back to where I\'d left some Wild Mushrooms but the game would kind of blink and I\'d be in an opposite location.  I think it\'s because I had him outside of his pit.  I still killed him easily.\n\nThe only problem I had was Rajaxx on my first attempt.  I waited for the waves to come one at a time which was probably my mistake.  By the time Rajaxx showed up I\'d used my pot cooldown and Innervate was on cooldown and I didn\'t have enough mana.  I had to try to keep myself up with Lifebloom and Rejuv AND dps him while he was doing his huge knockback attack which takes like 40% (?) of your health.  I got him to like 50% before I died regardless.\n\nWhen I rezzed and ran back into the instance I got back to Kurinaxx\'s area and suddenly 3 or 4 of Rajaxx waves were coming at me simultaneously.  I am not sure why this happened but it turned out to be for the best.  Those mobs have about 30k health and "officers" (Major, Colonel, etc.) have about 50k.  I popped Barksin, Thorns and Starfall and that took care of most of them.  All at the same time.  With Wild Mushroom being instant cast now that could help as well, but I didn\'t need it.  Took out the remaining waves easily.  So it seems best if you AOE multiple waves at once, instead of waiting for them.  When I got down to one officer I decided to let him bang on me while I waited out an Innervate cooldown.  3 minutes isn\'t that long and the officers generally only do about 1000-1500 damage a hit.  Killed him and then came Rajaxx.  I put some Wild Mushrooms in his path, popped my Treants, Barksin, Thorns, Starfall, kept my dots up, Starsurge at the beginning but after that I didn\'t get much chance to cast long nukes.  I hit Starsurge when it was instant but mostly relied on instant cast stuff, Typhoon won\'t knock him back but it\'s another source of instant cast damage.  I did not need a potion that time.\n\nAfter that I decided to play it safe with the rest of the bosses\' environmental gimmicks.  Although, Moam was a joke and so was Ayamiss.  I imagine Ayamiss would be more difficult for a melee class but I dpsed it down without any adds appearing or any summoning to an altar.  I kited Buru to the eggs and had no problem.  I used the columns on Ossarian to remove his 300% damage bonus buff and to try to get him vulnerable to one of my schools of magic.  I got lucky on the second column and got Arcane.  He wasn\'t letting me cast Starfire so I Moonfire spammed him down for the last few percent, heh.  I only needed two columns.\n\nThis instance seems to be a lot about keeping moving while fighting a boss and hella knockbacks from mobs and bosses.\n\nI got an awesome amount of rep.

Moam still rarely drops the blacksmithing pattern as well that can net in the thousands. \n\nA few tips when you are in there: \n- The "Flesh Hunter" oozling mobs should get kill priority when they are aggroed as they can use a \'Consume\' ability which spells insta-death for any class without an effect like Divine Shield to break it.\n- General Rajaxx uses an ability that will halve your HP, but you need not worry as it is percentage based so will never actually kill you. It can be resisted (nature) and should only be used twice in a lvl85 kill.\n- The bug trash at Moam has a pushback that punts you 30+ yards and can chain you half way across the area. \n- Ayamiss has a flying phase for the first 30% which means melee needs to think of a way to do ~100k damage at range while a poison debuff stacks on them. \n- While Buru is best defeated using her original strategy busting the eggs (Dismember damage adds up), Ossirian can safely be zerg\'ed down.',1617954,0,'0',0);

It is the second hardest dungeon currently in release, coming in progression after BWL and before Naxxramas (the top dungeon).\n\nThe main reputation earned and used in this dungeon is the Brood of Nozdormu, which is earned from trash mobs and boss tokens.  It is recommended that you DO NOT turn in your boss tokens until you can no longer earn reputation off of trash mobs ().\n\nYou can get your tier 2.5 drops off the bosses in this zone.  These sets are 5 piece sets such as the Genesis, Oracle, Enigma, Avenger\'s, etc. sets.  The pieces the bosses drop can be turned in to the NPCs after the first boss.  Only later bosses drop these pieces.  The bosses, their loot, and a simple overview:\n\n1. The Prophet Skeram: He drops random high level epics, including the Breastplate of Annihilation.  At every quarter of his life he splits into 3 bosses, 2 shades and himself.  He also has a mind control ability.  The general strategy is to sheep the mind controlled person and DPS down his shades as quick as possible.\n\n2. The Bug Family (OPTIONAL): They drop random high level epics including warrior and rogue nature resistance gear.  The fight consists of 3 bugs named Lord Kri, Princess Yauj, and Vem.  Kri has an AoE poison volley, Yauj has a heal and AoE fear.  Vem has a random charge.  The order that you kill them determines the loot you get.  The strategies for each are rather involved, but you can find summaries at wowwiki.com.\n\n3. Battleguard Sartura - Sartura flies around a large room after the bug trio.  She comes with 3 additional elite mobs, and drops random high level epics including nice caster nature resistance gear.  Sartura and her adds have the same abilities.  They have a nasty frontal attack, as well as an uninteruptable whirlwind where they fly randomly around doing huge amount of AoE damage.  They must be stunned in order to prevent this from occuring.  DPS the adds down until you are left with Sartura.  This is a TIMED encounter, and if you do not kill her within 10 minutes she will destroy your raid.  At 20% she goes into a mini-enrage and should be DPSed down quickly.\n\n4.  Fankriss the Unyielding:  Fankriss drops high level epics including the Ancient Qiraji Ripper, Mantle of Wicked Revenge, Fetish of the Sand Reaver, and shadow resistance gear for warlocks.  There are many ways to do this fight.  Fankriss himself is very similar to the AQ20 boss Kurinnaxx in that you must alternate tanks to prevent the debuff from stacking.  He has a few unique abilities that must be handled:  every few seconds a large yellow bug is spawned which must be killed before it enrages or it will wipe the raid.  He also has smaller adds that come and must be tanked and AoE\'d down after a while.  Manage the adds and the fight is your\'s.',7713,0,'0',0);
insert into aowow_comments_wh value (7717,7,3428,7717,'2006-06-12 00:00:00','5. Princess Huhuran:  Huhu drops the Tier 2.5 quest piece for shoulders and boots.  The Huhuran encounter is a Nature Resist fight.  The first 70% of her life is very straight forward and only involves switching tanks so the debuff does not stack too high.  At 30% Huhu enrages and hits the 15 closest people (note: PETS NO LONGER COUNT) with a very high damage and rapidly firing AoE nature spell.  High NR is needed to live through this.  \n\n6:  The Twin Emperors:  The Twin Emps drop the 2.5 quest piece for the helm piece.  The fight consists of fighting two bosses with a SHARED healthbar, one is a caster who is immune to physical damage (vek\'lor) and the other is a physical damage boss immune to magical spells (vek\'nilash).  The physical damage boss should be tanked with a warrior, and the magical damage one with a warrior or a warlock with high shadow resistance.  The fight is one of the hardest fights in the instance and is a major trying point for guilds.  More information on their wide amount of abilities can be found at wowhead.com.\n\n7: Ouro the Sandworm (OPTIONAL):  Ouro is the optional boss found between the twin emps and C\'thun.  He drops the tier 2.5 quest piece for the leggings.  I have relatively little experience with this boss.  His main abilities are a sand blast which \n\naffects all raid members in a cone in front of him, and his bury ability, which causes him to bury underground and run under your raid for heavy nature damage.  The idea is to avoid the sand blasts and his underground damage.  More information on this encounter can be found at wowwiki.com.\n\n8: C\'thun:  C\'thun is the last and hardest boss of the instance.  He drops the quest piece for the tier 2.5 chestpiece.  I have no experience against this boss.  The fight has 2 stages, the first stage involves spreading out and avoiding eye lasers, the second involves killing tenticles and getting out of his stomach.

I came to give my two cents about solo\'ing this at 90 on a priest.[/b]\n\nI\'ve never attempted to solo this before on my priest since at 80, even 85 - the dmg output of most the of mobs could be almost unmanageable. Now our health pools are so large this isn\'t a big deal.\n\n[b]Tips:[/b]\n[b]1.[/b] Don\'t pull too big since a lot of these mobs can fear, mind control, punt you into the air causing massive fall damage, etc. Pull too big and get punted into a boss room isn\'t fun - especially on \'The Bug Trio.\'\n[b]2.[/b] Be patient. The bosses have ridiculous amts of hp and some have self healing, stuns, and silences. Keep yourself bubbled, I have Glyph of Power Word: Shield on my Shadow spec so i get free heals from it which is handy so you don\'t have to switch out of shadow to heal yourself.\n[b]3. [/b]Glyph of Vampiric Embrace helped a lot, I almost never had to pop out of shadow form because of this.\n[b]4.[/b] [i]Edited Area since PW: Solace[/i] is no longer available in shadowform. Use Mind Spike on the Anubisath-type mobs. They like to become immune to shadow dmg a lot, Mind Spike does \'shadowfrost\' dmg.\n[b]5.[/b] If you\'re in a group with someone, make sure you looted your Lord\'s Insignia off the bosses in AQ40. I noticed in a group, even if you clicked to loot, sometimes the insignia doesn\'t loot. On Twins, make sure you loot BOTH bosses.\n[b]6.[/b] If you\'re revered with Cenarion Circle it\'s okay to skip trash in AQ40 since it stops giving rep. Except the Anubisath-type mobs in the hall before Twins, clear them of they will pull when you pull the boss.\n\nWhat I experienced:\n\n[b]The Prophet-[/b] Just keep dotting away and bubbling. Eventually it will die.\n\n[b]Battleguard Sartura -[/b] Mind Sear her adds off and then dps until dead.\n\n[b]Fankriss -[/b] Not nearly as annoying as the one in Ruins. Dps until dead.\n\n[b]Viscidus -[/b] I was unable to solo this boss. Mind spike worked awesomely as Frost Dmg but I was unable to melee him fast enough to \'Shatter\' him with a 1.8 speed dagger. Since I can\'t DW  I am thinking I might need alternate methods. I am pondering the use of trinkets that summon helpful (dps adds) or my shadow fiend. (Will test this and report back.) - So I tested this and I am sad to say I was unable to solo him. I got him to the \'It looks like he\'s about to shatter!\' emote but to no avail, he wouldn\'t shatter. I popped my Netheringwing Ally and Mindbender and melee\'d with a 1.6 speed dagger along with taking a potion of speed (500 haste.) I think this might be possible for someone who has the Barov Peasant Caller (no longer obtainable.) For some reason I no longer have mine so was unable to test this. WIth my melee and Mindbender I was getting him to the \'about to shatter\' emote (no potion and no ally.) I\'d be curious to see if someone with the Peasant Caller could manage to get it (priest preferrably.) I also tried punching him - also got the \'about to shatter\' emote. I am assuming I was maybe 4-6 more hits away from shattering him.\n\n[b]Princess Huhuran -[/b] Dots. She is a cranky one with the stuns/silence.\n\n[b]The Twin Emperors -[/b] This is an extremely irritating encounter. Find the one that isn\'t immune to shadow dmg and start dotting. You notice there are two stair cases leading up to the bosses, I strongly suggest you stand in the V shape between the stairs and back wall. These guys knock back over and over and over. At first I was using the  wall behind them but since they teleport they eventually got behind me, knocked me out.. annoying. The V was perfect. I didn\'t get knocked out. This will take a long time (if you\'re like me, being shadow in your holy gear because you\'re too lazy to gear a proper set) so just keep dotting away. There are a lot of interrupts so try to Mind Flay AFTER a knock back or not at all to help with mana. Make sure you have the talent Divine Insight for that chance to instant cast Mind Blast.\n\n[b]Ouro -[/b] This giant worm is annoying until you run to a wall and put your back to it. Then just dot him up and wait out his submerges. At 90 his quaking dmg will either miss or absorb into your bubble.\n\n[b]C\'thun -[/b] Pretty easy. The only stage that killed me once was when he teleported me inside EDIT: I am wondering if they fixed something since the debuff stacked up for 5 and was only for 750 per tick, hardly touching my health pool this time. The teleport cancels shadowform (still) which is extremely irritating when you don\'t realize it for a few seconds. So, once teleported inside DoT the tentacles AS SOON as they are in range. Kill them as fast as you can. Once back outside get the DoT\'s on cthun - ignore the other tentacles. Mindflay, Mind Blast, etc. Get him down fast so you don\'t get teleported inside again.\n[b]Note[/b]: If you die on C\'thun wait a couple minutes before running inside. I made the mistake of running in and C\'thun was still active. It teleported me inside of him and I died pretty quickly as I had not healed myself to full, buffed, or anything.\n\n[i][b]Edited with more specific information:[/b][/i]\n[b][i]Rep Gains[/i]:[/b]\nYou start at Hated with Brood of Nozdormu.

Completing the armor quests should give 500+ rep with Cenarian Circle and Brood of Nozdormu (depending on which items you\'re getting.) Completing http://DBURLHERE/?quest=8595 Mortal Champions  should reward 500+ rep with both CC and BoN (this is the repeatable quest to turn in http://DBURLHERE/?item=21229 Qiraji Lord\'s Insignia  which only drops off bosses in AQ 40.) Bosses in AQ 40 should award BoN rep (w/ guild perks) +110 x5 (this amount rewarded five times) and CC rep +220. Killing C\'thun will give BoN rep +550 x5 (this amt is rewarded five times.) Trash will stop giving rep at Revered status with CC. http://DBURLHERE/?item=21230 Ancient Qiraji Artifact  has a chance to drop which should give 1000+ rep with Brood of Nozdormu. If I had to estimate, it would take 3-6 runs of both Ruins and AQ40 to get exalted with CC. In Ruins of AQ trash gives rep for CC (about 10-11) per trash mob, even at revered but only bosses give a small amt of BoN rep.\nYou can repeat the armor quests multiple times for +550 rep (with perks).\n\nMy priest is in Raid Finder gear - ilvl 483. I feel this would go much better if I had a separate set for shadow. In my holy gear I have a ridiculous amount of hit rating, probably not enough haste and crit. My dmg output was significantly less than someone who is geared specifically for shadow.\n\nHope this helps the next curious priest :)',1816289,0,'0',0);

It\'s also necessary to put our character in a corner, so they can\'t throw you in air and inflict fall damage. When they stay near it\'s less probable they exchange position, so you can\'t lost the focus on your target.\nFor warriors it\'s important do a lot of dps (each emperor it\'s a 2M life target) and self heal in some ways, as potions or enchants. For me 143K health, full Cata gear and specially Second Wind Talent do the job.\n\nWhen entering the Emperor room Vek\'nilash is on the right, Vek\'lor on the left. Run with your mount to Vek\'nilash and make him follow to the small corner on the extreme right of the entering stairs. In this corner, with stairs on left and wall on right, you will stay fixed with both Emperors near and in your range.\nNow go with dps and self healing and control to not to loose your target (Vek\'nilash) or loose your health. When you kill one, both dies. Make extended use of Aoe damage because there are lot of spawns that will arrive in this corner. Any silencing ability like Disrupting Shout is welcomed.\nI do the job in about 5 mins of fight, Second Wind hold my health above 25% and never use a healing potion. Every buff that increase resistence/damage is welcomed.\n\nWhen they die, the small door at your back opens and you are free to go to the last two bosses: Ouro and C\'Thun.\n\nNext days I will try to solo them, hope to write more on the battle...\n\nHi to all.\n\nP.S. - Guys who make magical damage can try the same strategy with Vek\'lor, going in the simmetrical angle on the left of the entering stair.',1786557,0,'0',0);

Capturing and defending nodes are often not done enough, and results in losses. Many Alliance players often complain of losing - this is not because of horde twinks, or anything similar, but because of poor leadership. I have won many games before as Alliance when teamwork was done.\n\n-Capturing Nodes.\nThis is a must. You cannot win with no nodes, you don\'t get any resources.\nHowever, don\'t just capture the nearest point you see.\nTry to capture nodes which are strategically useful, and look for weaknesses. If 10 enemies are defending BS, don\'t keep zerging it with teammates; loop around to GM, and capture that instead. Capture points to keep enemy confused and on the move all the time. Don\'t try to be heroic and capture something all by yourself, or race to capture it first. Work as a team.\nCapture strategically, not honorably.\nOnly 3 are needed, and ST+BS+LM or Farm+BS+LM is a strong combo. Try getting BS if possible, it is easy to defend and retake if taken.\n\n-Defending\nFighting nomad fashion is no use. Just capturing a base does not win the game, it\'s keeping a point. Defending is a must, and with a team of 15 where 3 is required to win, 5 per point is enough to hold back most assaults.\nRespond to \'incs\', but at the same time only say \'inc\' if it is serious. If you are level 49 and you see some level 40 trying to capture a base, chances are you can kill him/her. Do not spam BG chat by saying \'inc\' every time you see an enemy.\nTry to go to serious incs as fast as possible, if the point you are defending is fine. A good team moves their troops around and pushes back all assaults, meanwhile keeping at least 3 or 4 at each point for defence.\nAnother point - if a base is lost, it\'s lost. If 10 horde are capturing  Stables, let it go, it\'s not the end of the world. Don\'t keep sending waves of 5 to attack them, it is a waste of time and troops. Instead, while they are occupied at Stables, go around to all the other bases, as they will not be well-defended. \n\nDo not go off and farm HKs, or try to charge into 10 enemies heroically. It can be boring to just defend, but winning gives far more honour and joy. A good team can have a lot of fun working together, and is far better than losing again and again, dying thousands of times on the way.\n\nDo not flee. If you die, you die.',7619,0,'0',0);

Also, the message will encourage people to leave the node they\'re defending (or leaving the offensive group) to go help the node that was ninja\'d, giving the other team a huge advantage of fighting a weakened offense or defense.[/small][/li][li]Fight at the flag or keep an eye on the flag intently.[small] I\'ve had several cases where the defending group wandered off while fighting some attackers when a ninja came and took the flag, causing the defending team to lose their graveyard. Usually, when the message come up saying <base> has been assaulted, the whole defending group will run back to the flag. If they were still fighting baddies, the enemy can score several hits while the defender was running. In addition, it\'s near impossible to retake a flag whilst being pounded upon. If you can\'t defeat the attackers quickly enough, you\'ll lose even more time.[/small][/li][li]Listen to others. [small]If the one who is giving out orders seems reasonable, listen to him or her. Being organized is one of the best values in a team.[/small][/li][li]Outwit your foe. [small]"Inc, Stables!" ... Lots of defenders go to the stables... While everyone is fighting at stables, other nodes will be undefended (Dependent on the team). By the time someone says "Inc LM!" defenders at ST would think, "Heck no, I\'ve got lots of honor kills right here!"[/small][/li][li]Speak up. [small]If you\'re the only one defending, be sure to call out a possible inc so the node may be saved. If you sit around and fight on your own, it would be too late. Likewise, be sure to state the number of attackers, no use in sending half your team to a death pit.[/small][/li][li]Make proper judgments. [small]If a node gets assaulted, do not rush to that base immediately, but make a small judgments. If it was a simple ninja, go for it. If there are lots at the node (usually accompanied by "[node] overrun"), it\'s probably not wise to try to defend the assaulted base, and even a better tactic to attack another base, as everyone is at the attacked node. A social group would be easier to handle this tip, as they would be calling out incs and giving you a judgment before it gets taken.[/small][/li][li]As an added bonus from the previous tip, [small]once you assault the other base and trigger the attack warning, the defending team at stables (say... they recently attacked stables, and you attacked lumber mill because you made that judgment) would most likely rush to defend LM and leaving stables undefended, and a small band of players can take stables with ease. If LM succeeded at defending, you\'ve got yourself two nodes. This takes a considerable amount of balance, and that\'s hard to get in BGs unless it\'s a premade.[/small][/li][li]Try not to die. [small]Well duh. But what I\'m mainly referring to is the first death. Deaths after that are insignificant. Why? Because in the beginning, you have all these buffs (Dependent on the team)...

Though it is quite possible to win without taking the Blacksmith, it will make your defensive strategy more difficult.\n\nThere are two basic ways to hold your 3 nodes, either in a "triangle" pattern which includes the Blacksmith (such as having Stables, Mine, and Blacksmith), or to have a "line" pattern which tends to not include the Blacksmith (such as having Stables, Mine, and Farm). \n\nOf these, the "Triangle" is vastly easier to defend, since you can keep a small group at each flag while everyone else roams around and responding to incomings from the opposing team. Your ability to speedily reinforce any 3 of the nodes in this triangle pattern is considerable, and an opponent would have to engage in a very fast and brutal zerg to be able to overrun part of this triangle, which often leaves the opponent vulnerable in another area, where your team can then launch a counterattack, re-establishing the position. \n\nThe "line" however is much more difficult to defend, since you have two nodes at extreme ends of the map, which makes them vulnerable to attack. In the case of defending in this fashion, it is best to keep the bulk of your response team at the "middle" node in the line (aka, if you held Stables, Mine, and Farm, your response team should camp the mines largely) so that they can respond to an attack quickly on either of the extreme ends of your position. This position is vulnerable since the enemy can shift attacks on one of the extreme ends, then attack the other before your response team can arrive.\n\nIn any case, the key to winning in AB is to sieze your 3 nodes quickly, to have all of your defenders call out any incoming attacks upon those nodes, and to have a rapid response team to reinforce those nodes under attack.',7949,0,'0',0);

When defending on your own stay far enough off the flag that if you\'re cc\'d (sapped) they have to run over to the flag to cap it. This buys you time and also means that if you trinket the cc, they\'re not in range to instantly apply another. (damn rogues) To go with this if you have a pet, sit it on the flag if you will whilst you stay ranged. \n2. When defending solo keep cheap AOE up, either on the flag or yourself. Effects like consecration, flamestrike and death &amp; decay will last a few seconds and will break stealth if enemies enter. \n3. Defending again. Have a least one person keep AOE effects on the flag, this can make it near impossible for an opposing team to cap. If I\'m pressured I\'ll blink around spamming Arcane Explosion (preferable to Blizzard which requires channelling) to stop capping and gives time for your team mates to pull back into position.\n4. More defence!  If you die you can run back to your corpse and manually ress, this can be really useful to stop a cap (see above) as if you manually ress and drop some AOE such as Arcane Explosion you\'ll stop everyone capping. However the time you can ress this way increases each time until it\'s better just to wait to be spirit healed. \n5. If you\'re forced back to your starting base due to being camped but control at least another base you can spirit run to that base instead of being ganked.',1890902,0,'0',0);

PuG\'s on the alliance side have no coordination, and dislike eachother.\n\nSecond, you need a group of 7. Make sure they are rather skilled, because these players will be of most use to you.\n\nThirdly, you need 2 groups of four. One group to keep teh lumber mill okay, and the other to keep the mine defended. If necessary only go for a 3 - 2 win instead of the 4 - 1. In that case, one to defend stables, and the other mines. Make sure that these two groups are evenly distributed with class sets. Do not stock up on one class, and none on the other. Have say, a drui, preist, pally, and warrior on one, and maybe a rogue, mage, pally, and preist on the other, for example.\n\nNow, on to the group of 7. You need to keep this group as coordinated as possible. Teamspeak is almost a must, unless you have been doing this for a while. (What you are about to read is the 4 node to 1 node strategy) You need to keep these 7 bouncing from Stable to Blacksmith, Stable to Blacksmith. Keep say, 4 at BS nad 3 at stables, and when one is in large enough trouble, bring almost all, say 6, or all 7, to that posission. And fight it off, and the return to the original posts. Now, if one spot that is being defended by four, such as the mines is under attack, and it is almost all of the enemy, bring most or all of yer group of 7 to aid them, and then return the 4 to BS, and 3 to Stables.\n\nKeep this up until you reach 2000.\n\n(3 to 2 node version.)\n\nKeep the BS, LM (Lumber Mill) and Stables. Put the group of 7 at the BS, and the other to groups at the stables and LM. It is very similar to the 4 to 1 version, where the group of seven goes to aid whichever is being overrun too much, and then returns to the original node.\n\nWell, i hope that helps anyone out there in AB.

Killing a person may be nice, but winning is even better - you get far more honour and joy. It is a game of Capture the Flag, but there is a lot more invovled, and strategy is required to win. Level is not the most important aspect, it\'s teamwork.\n\n- Defence is usually overlooked, as it seems ineffective. \nHowever, if properly defended (with hunters\' traps, stealthed rogues, etc), the flag can be impossible to take. 5 people are enough to defend, but if there are less there is no point in any defence - the group is just too small.\n\n- Getting the flag is obviously the most important thing, and the two best Flag Carriers are Druids (because of fast travel form) and Paladins (because of bubbling and high survivability). However, level is more important. Do not be selfish and take the flag as a level 40, when there is a level 49 just behind you who is a far better candidate.\n\n- Supporting the Flag Carrier is essential. \nA player cannot run all the way solo pursued by 10 enemies. There are many ways to help, one of the most obvious is healing. Others including stunning, dazing, freezing, sheeping, sapping, etc. Actually killing the chasers is the last resort, as your primary goal is defending the flag carrier. Killing that little gnome or slow tauren may result in exposure of the flag carrier. When the flag has been scored, THEN turn and kill them.\n\n-Get the flag back! \nAnother crucial point - you cannot score if the enemy has your flag. A 5 man group is usually efficient to hunt down the flag, with 5 left to defend Flag Carrier. Do not just kill, you haven\'t scored yet.

If you have a good team (Keep in mind a lot of pug\'s may not listen to or follow a plan.), I recommend you split your group into a group of 4 and two groups of 3. Make sure the bg leader organizes the parties so that everyone is partied with the people they will be working with, and that there is a healer in every group.\n\n The group of 4, and one of the groups of 3 will be staying in midfield. This means they can be both offense and defense. They can stop the enemies from crossing over to your side, and in the event that someone does get the flag, you can easily intercept him on his way back. If you were in the base, but didn\'t see the carrier, you wouldn\'t know which way he went, however out in midfield, you\'ll be able to see him whether he jumps off the gy, goes out the tunnel, or down the ramp. Also if one of the groups is in trouble, the other group can come assist them.\n\n The most important aspect of teamwork, and I cannot stress this enough, is to FOCUS FIRE. That means everybody needs to attack the same target. Call out targets, so everybody knows who needs to be downed first. Healers, classes with weak armor/hp, and classes with nasty crowd control are often prime targets. Make sure to support your buddies as well. If one of your group members is being focused on, heal them! Having a good healer is like having 2 dps\'ers. Also if the flag is taken, you should ping the map and tell everybody in bg chat where he is. COMMUNICATE.\n\n The capturing team dosn\'t need to worry so much about killing the enemies that try to get their flag back, as slowing them down so the carrier can escape. Snare, root, stun, and fear them if you have the proper crowd control, and keep healing the carrier. Stay close to the carrier at all times, if he dies, you need to grab the flag and keep going.\n\n While this is happening, one of the midfield groups should be moving toward your enemies\' base to help the carrier get home by healing him, and killing or hampering your foes\' progress. Once you can slow all the enemies to the point where they are half the field\'s length behind you, its usually a walk in the park to get it home.\n\n So overall, stay together, attack the targets that are being attacked, heal your buddies, and never yell at your team. Yelling at them makes a loss even worse. Keep in mind that new players, and stubborn players may not listen to you, even if your ideas are better. If 8 people are turtling inside your base, advise them to move out, but don\'t be a jerk about it. Follow these steps, and your on your way to becoming a great pvp\'er.',176370,0,'0',0);

When enemy speed is more limited to your own, you\'re not at as much of a disadvantage.\nGet the speed boost, even if you have to stop to wait for your healers, better that the enemy chasing you does not have it.\nRules are the same inside your base, only good reason not to take tunnel is if it\'s full of enemy players.  Your limited speed is not as much of a disadvantage in the tunnel as it is on the ramp.  IF you are a warrior you can intervene to players at the graveyard, but you need to be communicating with your allies to do this.\nThe BEST place to stand is in the flag room, on the house side of the flag stand.  You can LoS the roof from here, while not LoSing the graveyard side of the FR so players who die can quickly res to come back and defend/heal you.  Players are forced to move in very close or close to the graveyard to attack you, making them easier to pick off.  You are also guaranteed a cap if the enemy team drops your flag, because you will cap as soon as it spawns before anyone can pick it up.\nUSE a battle standard if you have one.  15% extra health is nothing to sneeze at, and nobody seems to go after them.  A good place to put this is behind a pillar of the flag room box, out of view from players in the flag room or on the roof/mid level.\nThe enemy is trying to kill you, don\'t let them lure you out.  Your allies can always hide with you if they get in trouble.\nCall out if you\'re going to die, so offense can get ready to CC the enemy flag carrier and grab their flag again.\nBe willing to pass the flag to players better equipped to take hits than you are.  You did a great job getting across the field, but perhaps the warrior with 500 more resilience and 10k more HP would be a better flag carrier now that you are in your base.  LET PEOPLE KNOW if you are doing this.\n\nIF you are lead:\nMark the healers.  Flag carrier can easily see this way who to run to if they need heals, even if they\'re too busy to run to you.\n\nDefense:\nSTAY with your flag carrier.  Those guys on the roof are just trying to get you out of the flag room so they can burst your flag carrier down.  Don\'t fall for it.  There are plenty of places to LoS inside the flag room.  DO NOT chase enemies for the kill if it means leaving your flag carrier defenseless.  This is losing sight of the goal which is to capture flags.  If your healers die on defense you can run to the graveyard, but if you don\'t have the flag make sure to CC the enemy so the flag runner can make it.  You will res when the healer does, so make sure you die quickly if you\'re going to die at all. Be ready to grab the enemy flag if your flag carrier drops it.\n\nOffense:\nStay in a group, you are more powerful in force than alone.\nAssign somebody to CC/Burst each healer with the enemy flag carrier to make sure you have it covered.  You will need to either kill or CC their healers in order to bring down their flag carrier.  Remember coordinate this, you will only have about 30 seconds from when the first healer dies until they are back in the flag room.  NOTE this is a big reason why not to defend places other than the flag room.\nBe ready to grab the flag!  Not only your flag to return but their flag if your flag carrier drops it and it gets returned.  The enemy cannot capture the flag if you are holding their flag.  If the situation happens where the offense grabs the flag and both flags are in the enemy base, you should retreat as a group.  The enemy has far greater incentive to kill your flag carrier than you do to kill their flag carrier at this time, because if you drop their flag they get a point, where as if they drop your flag, they chase you across the field for 90 seconds before you get a point, if they don\'t manage to get your flag first or kill you.\nCall out where the enemy flag carrier is so you know where to go.  People will wander around pointlessly getting picked off without direction.\n\nIf you\'re going to defend, do it with the enemy flag.  If the enemy team grabs your flag and escapes, you\'re screwed if you were all in your base.  That being said you should be with a flag at all times.  If both flags are in their base, EVERYBODY should be in their base, or dead.  Fighting players where there are no flags is a waste of your attention, and if you kill somebody you have gained nothing.  It may be faster and more worth it to let yourself die than to fight for a few minutes in a gridlock.\n\nDO NOT get trapped where the flag is not.  Either flag.  Fighting in the middle or anywhere else where the flags are not is a sure way to get your team a loss.  Wouldn\'t it have been nicer if the warrior you killed was the one attacking your flag carrier or the healer you killed was healing their flag carrier, instead of the one riding through the center of the field?\n\nBreak up the other team.  CC will help with this.  It\'s much easier to take on a few players than the whole team, and if you can slow/CC your enemy to make this possible you\'re doing well.  This does not mean fight in the middle.  If you need to let yourself die to get out of a gridlock situation in the middle of the map do it.  The score is based on flags captured not kill:death ratio.\n\nKeep people motivated!  We know the priest in leveling greens is awful, we don\'t need to hear it from you.  Let people know when a heal saved you, or when coordination lets you get another flag.  Teams who feel like they are doing well, do well.  If you\'re spending all your energy calling somebody terrible over the internet, you\'re not spending it winning the battleground.\n\nNEVER farm honor kills in WSG.  If you want to farm honor kill achievements, queue for AV or IoC, higher player BGs result in higher returns and kills in these BGs actually directly help your team win.  Not only are you helping your team lose by pointlessly killing players in WSG, but you are griefing BOTH sides by refusing to capture the flag, when the game is capture the flag.

I would have a rogue and hunter on defense, as well as a shaman if necessary.\n\nThe object, aside from capturing the flag, is keep the opposition midfield but maintaining an effective offense at the same time. In  a perfect situation the opposition will have Approximately 3 on defense unless theyre turtling the rest will be all out offense. Take a frost mage a druid and a priest ramp side up to the second level, have the druid grab the flag and exit as according to reports from your midfield team. With two on defense and three of offense that leaves 5 midfield, a priest, a mage, a druid, and two shamans forming a self sustaining group whos objective is to try to keep the opposition midfield as much as possible and support the flag carriers on their exit\n\nSituations change and tactics should be adjusted to accomodate these changes however this strategy as posted should be effective, please comment',10782,0,'0',0);

If you have good comunication you will be able to do all of these things effectively you will win 99% of the time.\n\n    Another big thing is acting in groups. most people think they\'re cool and will go for the flag or a big group of enemys alone. They normally end up dying and disrupting the plans of the whole team.\n\n    Obviously the biggest part of the battle is flags. Most people sucseed when they defend or assult the flag in groups. For every person in the assult group your chances double. Don\'t send your whole team in and leave no one defending though , 3 or 4 people is the optimum group. The same rules apply to defence. I know veryone hates, defence they want to get out there and get some of the action but it is probobly even more important then getting the flag. You cant win if your enemy already has.\n\n     Another smaller but still important part of the strategy is map control. its great when you can cofine the enemy to a small area and just get the flag at whim. Again don\'t send in your whole team for this though. Say someone secretly slips through and the flag is picked up. The whole team freaks out and runs back to the base. This gives the other team time to regroup and often the tables are turned\n\n So lets recap.[ul][li]Commuication - If yours is better you will win 99%of the time.[/li][li][/li][li]Groups -  Going in alone may feel brave but will only backfire on you and your team/[/li][li][/li][li]Flags  - Not a solo job.

Accept it, and enter Blackrock Spire.\n\nIn being at the dungeon (Blackrock Spire, whose portal is a ways in to the room where Lothos  is), you will take the Abandoned Mole Machine to "Just past the Grim Guzzler", and walk towards a ring of mobs. From there you can attempt to pass them, or kill them.\n\nTake a right turn at the first opening to the right of the mobs, and (NPC #9156), a boss named Ambassador Flamewrath, will be there. Be sure not to leave any friends you may be taking outside one far end, or the other, of the boss fight chamber, as engaging him will cause a set of elite elemental giants to spawn on both sides of the sets of entrances and exits. They do give experience and drop loot, but if, for instance, you were running a friend through the dungeon who is a straggler, or who gets ahead, they would possibly die if they were too far behind you or ahead of you because of the additional mobs that spawn due to boss engagement. Again, you may attempt to pass the boss, or kill him.\n\nFrom there, travel through a chamber to the left of the boss, and you\'ll find a room full of golems and non-elite dwarves. On chance, you\'ll run into a rare golem, and I\'m not sure if he gives high amounts of experience over the regular mobs/elite mobs. He drops bind-on-pick up gear, which benefits only few.\n\nFrom there, at the other side of the room, is a way into the next room. "The Seven" will be there, confront and speak to the 1 of 7 dwarves at the far back, and you\'ll commence a "boss fight". Slay each of the dwarves as they attack, and be swift. If one isn\'t killed fast enough, another will engage as well, on a set timer. Once they are cleared, a cache next to the now-opening doorway appears that contains 2 of 4 rare pieces of gear.\n\nPass through the door (which is to the right of where the dwarf who starts the fight was, and where the loot chest is/was), and down-stairs through a hallway somewhere to the right should be a new doorway. Go through it and kill or pass a few elemental mobs, and you\'ll run across what I believe is titled "Fragment of the Core". Remember to pick it up to the left of the new portal, it\'s a chunk of black crystal. (It is required for the quest "Attunement to the Core".) [s]\n\nHopefully you will have somebody in your group, so you can convert your party to a Raid Group.[/s] [u][i][b]It appears that as of the Mists of Pandaria Expansion, whether you have it or not, you may now enter raids without needing to be in a Raid Group. This helps if, along the way to Molten Core, you don\'t want to be in a raid group, seeing as it prevents progressing on any non-raid quests you might be handling at the time (whether it be while waiting for a summon, or if completing quests while in the dungeon, etc.)[/b][/i][/u]\n\nFrom there you can bring up to 39 of your friends, or just 1 or 2, inside to do Molten Core. When you\'re done with Molten Core, you can run back to the entrance of the raid, exit it, and run back to the entrance/exit of Blackrock Depths (I believe that, on the odd chance as of Mists of Pandaria, exiting the raid portal will send you back to Blackrock Mountains, so that you won\'t have to walk through Blackrock Spire as well).\n\nUpon exit, make your way out of the cave and back to the area overlooking the lava, and Lothos will accept the "Fragment of the Core" for the quest. [u][i][b]After completion, whenever you talk to him, as a spirit or as alive, he can teleport you back into Molten Core, from there you may exit the Molten Core portal to end up in Blackrock (Depths\n/Spire?)/Blackrock Mountain, otherwise talking to Lothos for ease-of-access to Molten Core.[/b][/i][/u]\n\nNote: I just realized, at the point when you kill or pass Ambassador Flamewrath, if you have enough (regenerating health or powerful enough healing abilities [instant cast preferred]) you can jump off the ledge into the lava behind him; the issue is having enough fire resistance or having heals to sustain you as you wade North-bound, while hugging the West wall, to get across to the spot past the Fire Elementals on the ground prodding out of the lava a ways out. Keep hugging the wall until you hit a ramp. Head up it, take a left, and find the 3 Flame Elementals blocking your path, kill or pass and then hang another left and cross the bridge ahead, and from there you\'re to the portal into Molten Core. \n\n[u][i][b]Note 2: Please recognize this if you are to take the shortcut mentioned in the previous note![/b][/i][/u] If you take the suggested shortcut route, and should you need to return to the dungeon, Blackrock Depths, from the raid, Molten Core: to get back to wherever it is you were wanting to go, you would be unable to, because of the fact that not killing the 7 Dwarves in their boss chamber, to get to the Molten Core Raid entrance portal, would result in being locked out from the outside of the 7 Dwarves chamber. Because of that, your only escape route, to my knowledge, is to use your hearthstone to leave the place. (As noted before, there is the off chance that you may find yourself, on exit of Molten Core by portal, at Blackrock Mountain vs. Blackrock Spire.)\n\nMajor Note 3: As of Mist of Pandaria\'s 5.4 PTR, one may now even use Lothos to teleport you to Molten Core (the same applies to the orb that teleports you to Blackwing Lair) without having had done the attunement quests (to my knowledge). Unless it was some PTR issue, or perhaps if the attunement was account bound, I noticed that my character had the quest to attune to Molten Core displayed while being able to teleport (as well as Blackwing Lair) while being capable of using both teleports. My friend, however, reported that he had no such access, and that he had to do both quests, even though suggesting he\'d done the quests before. This leads me to believe he either: recollected doing so on live, did the attunement on an alternate character and didn\'t happen to get attuned, PTR bugs had a hand in this, or just some other queer issue. Simply keep in mind that, the moment PTR 5.4 goes live, people should check that out. Although my assumption is that the effects are account wide (\'the effects\' being account-wide attunement access to teleporting) once someone has first done the quest on any given character, (similar to the Brawl Club), it is also very possible it was a PTR issue as of then unresolved, or perhaps it was something of another likeness. In any case, it is highly suggested that people test entry into such similar raids as Molten Core and Blackwing Lair due to the fact that if by any chance other raids requiring quest attunement to simply be given a shortcut entry can have the requirement of quest completion surpassed, well that\'s self-explanatory, I hope, but just to be clear, I simply mean this; If you\'ve perhaps done the quest on one character, come 5.4, the access of shortcut teleportation into the raid connected to the quest will come account-bound, so that you don\'t have to do 50 dungeon runs for access to the same raid.',1545504,0,'0',0);

Once both are dead start DPS?ing Lucifron. One thing you have to watch out for is his curse however. It will deal 2000 damage to you if not decursed. You can survive one or two, but it is best to get out of his curse range and bandage up and/or wait for a heal or two. Once you are back up, continue the DPS until Lucifron is dead.\n\nMagmadar (FR gear)\nFor this boss, wait until the MT leaves 5, count ?em, 5 sunders. This is very important so as you don?t take away the MT hate. Once the 5 sunders are in place, start DPS?ing Magmadar in the rear unless you want to be fried. Every now and then Magmadar will spit hot blobs of lava at a random person. Stay far away from those. They can do a hefty amount of damage to you in a short amount of time. Now if you want you can drink a Greater FR Potion to lessen the damage. It can and will save your life. Magamdar will also use an AoE fear every now and then. Have your trinket on so that you can nullify the fear. Only use it if you know you are being feared into one of those blobs of lava that he leaves. Otherwise just let it run out. Just follow the steps and Magmadar will be down in no time!\n\nGehannas (A little of FR and DPS gear)\nGehannas has 2 adds here just like Lucifron. Let the OT?s get their aggro and DPS the marked add and then the unmarked add. Once both are dead start using RANGED DPS!! NO MELEE WHATSOEVER!! Gehannas has a Rain of Fire AoE that can hurt a lot if you stay in it. If you see yourself taking damage from it, MOVE OUT OF IT! Just keep up the ranged DPS until either the raid leader says move in for melee or until Gehannas is dead.\n\nGarr (DPS gear)\nA lot of adds on this fight. Each will have their own mark and there will be either a tank or warlock on each one. When the fight begins, there will be one add with a Hunter?s Mark. That will be the first target to DPS. Once the add HP is down to about 20%, the raid warning will spam that it is exploding. That is your signal to move as far as possible before it explodes. Just keep on repeating until raid leader signals to DPS Garr. Garr will not explode here. Just DPS the hell out of ?em. A special thing about Garr that makes him different from the other elementals such as himself is that he can have bleed effects on him. So when the DPS begins on Garr, start using your Rupture. Once Garr is down, DPS will be back on the adds. Just do what you did with the ones from before and all will be good. For the last one, if you want to have some extra fun you can stick around and let that one explode in your face if HP permits!!\n\nBaron Geddon (DPS gear)\nThis is fun fight since you can be a living bomb! This fight is a RANGED DPS ONLY fight. I repeat RANGED DPS ONLY!! No one should be in melee range whatsoever. Before you start the RANGED DPS, let the MT get his aggro by waiting for the 5 sunders. Once the sunders are in place start shooting. Just keep the RANGED DPS on \'em thru out the fight. Sometime in the fight you may get a whisper and a warning saying that you are the bomb. When you do either run somewhere behind the raid or run into the cave. It all depends where you are at. After you get blown up bandage yourself up and get back to doing RANGED DPS. Just rinse and repeat and Baron will be done in no time.',12114,0,'0',0);

This is another RANGED DPS fight. Shazzrah has a mean Arcane Explosion and it gets even meaner when he puts his curse on ya that makes the AE a lor worse. Like with Baron, let the MT get his aggro. Once the sunders are in place, start the shooting. Every now and then Shazzrah will teleport to a random person. When that happens, STOP ALL DPS!!! I cannot stress that enough. When he teleport, don\'t run around like a chicken with its head cut off. Run towards the MT if you happen to get Shazzrah\'s attention. Once the MT regains his aggro, continue with the RANGED DPS. Just rinse and repeat.\n\nGolemagg (Mix of FR and DPS)\nGolemagg has two lil pet doggys that he has with him. I know they may look cute and all, but they are not a rogue\'s problem. Golemagg is the main target. The two pooches will be tanked seperately. When the fight starts, let the MT get his aggro. Once that is done start the DPS. Every now and then when you hit Golemagg you\'ll get a DoT called Magma Splash. This can stack up to 20 times. It may not seem bad early on, but if you can get enough on you it can turn your good day to a bad one. If you get more than 5 on you stop your DPS and let it run out. Anymore than 10 and you are in serious doo doo. If you want you can drink a Greater FR Potion to help deal with it. When Golemagg is at about 20% health, he will start throwing a angry fit. That\'s when you run out of melee range and start doing RANGED DPS until he is dead. I know you are getting tired of doing RANGED DPS, but it\'s necessary so that you don\'t get killed.\n\nSulfuron Harbringer (DPS Gear)\nLike the other Naga related bosses in MC, Sulf has his own henchmen to try and take care of his dirty work. But these adds can heal each other. In order to do this fight we have to make sure the adds don\'t heal each other at all. What will happen at the start of the fight is that there will be a tank on each add. One at a time the adds are going to be brought up the hill to where we can DPS it at. This is so that they cannot be within viewing range of their heals. Once the add is in position, start the DPS. If you see the add casting a spell, use Kick. This will cancel his spell and he will have to wait. Now since Kick has a CD not every rogue should kick. There should be a order at which we will kick the mob. Also try and make a macro to let the other rogues know that you are about to kick. Just repeat on the other adds and then we can DPS Sulf with no worries.\n\nMajordomo Executus (DPS Gear)\nAnother Naga with henchmen. Starting to see a pattern with all these henchmen and Naga?? Anyways Domo is a straight-up wuss!!! The man has 8 adds with him, 4 elites and 4 healers. Once the adds are down Domo will submit. Just attack which ever add the ADD MT/boss/ w/e  has targeted. Now if it\'s a healer, STUNLOCK IT!!!! I saw it with my own eyes. If we can stunlock the healers, it can help stop the damage that the tank is recieving from it. The elites are not stunable however. Just have to take them down the \'ol fashioned way. Just keep on attacking and don\'t still the tanks aggro. Domo will submit and then we will have his box of goodies.\n\nI haven\'t fought past Domo with a rogue, so sorry for not being able to support rogues past that point.',12116,0,'0',0);

What other plans are there to revisit the raids of vanilla World of Warcraft?\n\n[b]Stockton:[/b] One of our new raids is called Blackwing Descent and that takes place inside of Blackrock Mountain. Its very derivative of Blackwing Lair  the bosses and creatures you see in there, theres a chance some of those might be things youve actually seen in Blackwing Lair, so thats a very nostalgia-driven raid.\n\nFor the old raids themselves, youll see guild achievements added for them. Take the raid meta achievement that we have now, well have a new achievement that is a Classic Raid achievement  but its a guild achievement and thatll have a very specific reward attached to it, so even if youve completed it in the past, you may want to go back with your guild to get the reward.\n\n[b]Gameplanet:[/b] And those raids will still be tuned to their traditional levels?\n\n[b]Stockton:[/b] Exactly, so Molten Core will still be a level 60, 40-man raid  were not going to change that, even though you could probably do it with ten!Source: http://  http://www.gameplanet.co.nz/pc/games/159702.World-of-Warcraft-Cataclysm/features/135035.20100613.Blizzards-Cory-Stockton-on-designing-Cataclysm/ http://www.gameplanet.co.nz/pc/games/159702.World-of-Warcraft-Cataclysm/features/135035.20100613.Blizzards-Cory-Stockton-on-designing-Cataclysm/ ',1064594,0,'0',0);

Heavy melee attack. Random knockdown effect at the feet of it.\nHow to: Easy to tank but sometimes difficult to taunt them first. the knockdown effect is random so it can sometimes happen few seconds after being pulled to you and making you unable to taunt them right off. In this case chase it down if the hunter ran away and bring it back to infront of the raid away from the other giant/destroyer. Build aggro quick due to knockdown will pause your aggro building for a few seconds.\nRating: 3-6 (due to random knockdown)\n\nLava Packs\nCombo of 3-4 mobs. Flamewalker,Flameguard,Lava ReaverX1-2. \nFlamewalker: Heavy fire attacks and random fireballs. AoE reduce of FR (dispellable)\nFlameguard: Heavy fire attacks. AoE reduce of Armor. (not dispellable)\nLava Reaver: Medium melee based attack, also has cleave. Pyroclasm fireballs at random that stun and do heavy fire damage(resistable)\nHow to: The Flamewalker and Flameguard should be seperated, the reavers will be banished until both flame guys are dead. 1-2 tanks should stay back out of FR gear in their Tanking gear for the Lava Reavers.\nFlamewalker: 200+ FR needed to tank these, tank it away from raid facing away. keep it on you at all times this is killed first.\nFlameguard: 200+ FR needed to tank these, tank it away from raid facing away. this is killed second.\nLava Reaver: Tanking gear needed. the specified warriors that have tanking gear should stand near these while they are banished so they can taunt when they break banish so they dont own all the clothys and Knitemare. Tank the away from raid due to cleave effect. If no warrior has tanking gear on......god speed.\nRating: 5\n\nBosses!\n\nLucifron\nFirst boss in MC. AoE curse, Medium melee attack. Has 2 adds that can mind control at random.\nHow to: Requires 4 tanks here. The 2 adds will be pulled to the back of the raid and tanked and taken down 1 at a time. Lucifron will be pulled and tanked in front of the raid. ALL WARRIORS WILL USE AOE FEAR WHEN ITS UP!\nLucifron: MT will attempt to taunt him, sometimes the MT gets mond controled at the begining of the fight...the decided OT that will back up the MT will taunt Lucifron until the MT is dispelled and able to pick Lucifron back up. Once the MT has Lucifron the OT will get away from Lucifron and help take down adds.\nLucifron\'s adds: Tank these as best as you can due to random Mind controls done to you sometimes. Once dead dps Lucifron.\nRating: 5\n\nMagmadar\nSecond boss in MC. Medium melee attack. Frontal fire breath. Frenzy. AoE fear.\nHow to: The MT will tank Magmadar in one spot and never move. A warrior will face pull/bow Magmadar and run him to the MT. The MT should stand in zerker stance while Magmadar is being pulled. 5 seconds after Magmadar has been pulled...while hes running to the MT, the MT needs to hit Berserker Rage as to not get feared. and switch to defensive stance and begin tanking him. Every 30 seconds Magmadar will AoE fear...when the CT Raid says incoming fear 5 seconds! MT needs to switch into zerker stance wait 2 seconds and hit Berserker rage and then switch back to Defensive stance. Repeat this process until Magmadar is dead.  The MT needs to wear a mix of FR and tanking gear.\nRating: 8\n\nGehannas\nThird boss in MC. Medium melee attack. Rain of Fire spell. AoE curse. Random Shadowbolts. Has 2 adds with a stun effect.\nHow to: The MT will tank Gehnnas in front of the raid and will stand there the whole time. 4 OTs will stand to the left of where Gehannas stands. The first 2 OTs will tank the 2 adds, when they are stuned they will run away..the 2 secondary OTs will taunt the adds and bring them back to the first OTs and repeat as needed. The secondary OTs should stand a fair distance away from the adds to not get hit with the stun. Once adds dead dps Gehannas, move out of the Rain of Fire!\nRating: 3',13117,0,'0',0);

The mind control will always be resisted. Remove his curse during or after the fight depending on your gear.\n\nCore Hound packs - Aggro and blizzard down. Since there\'s an AoE damage cap, I would not recommend that you pull all of them at once as they very nearly killed me before I killed them.\n\nMagmadar - Nuke.

You can\'t interrupt all their heals, but they die in a few FoF ice lance crits or a good deep freeze crit.\n\nExecutus - This fight has the most potential to kill you; you should save time warp for this one. The adds can\'t be burned down with deep freeze, though they can be stunned with it. Let your pet tank as many of them as possible and burn them one by one. Don\'t kill yourself with spell reflect.

At 85 you can run past most of it.  I typically kill the Core Hounds just because their patrol paths make them a nuisance, and occasionally a Lava Surger will blunder into my path.  But the majority of the mobs can be skipped if desired, or easily dispatched if not.\n\n-Speaking of the Ancient Core Hounds, watch out for their Ancient Hysteria debuff;  A curse that reduces your Intellect and Spirit by 50%...and lasts 15 minutes.

The other four can be run past en route to Magmadar.  As for Luci himself...small health pool, adds can be killed with a couple of DoTs.  Remember to Dispel his magic debuff.  Finally ( and this is very important!) let the timer on his curse run out before you continue on...your spells costing double is not fun.\n\n-[b]Magmadar[/b] ~ Larger health pool, he\'ll take a little longer than some bosses.  Cast Fear Ward on yourself, and watch where you stand.  Otherwise he\'s not bad at all, even when enraged he doesn\'t damage you enough to matter.  He drops no gold, the cheapskate.\n\n-[b]Gehennas[/b] ~ Small health pool and a couple of weak adds, just like Luci.  His healing-reduction spell is meaningless, though the occasional stun is annoying.  Just keep your Shield up and blow him away.  Arguably the easiest boss in the instance.\n\n-[b]Garr[/b] ~ Try and keep DoTs on him while you blow up his adds.  He\'s not hard but it can take a little while to whittle away at so many targets.  Remember to recast your buffs after the fight is over.  Cross your fingers for some Bindings.\n\n-[b]Baron Geddon[/b] ~ Drag him into the hallway to "the spot" where you can wedge into the bend and not suffer much fall damage during Living Bomb.  Most important thing you can do is Dispel his magic debuff.  You won\'t even need Fire Resistance gear.  Hope for the Bindings.\n\n-[b]Shazzrah[/b] ~ Annoying!  Small health pool, laughable damage output, but he constantly Counterspells you.  DoTs will kill him just fine, though it takes a little while,  Consider dropping out of Shadowform for this fight;  If he locks out your Shadow spells you can amuse yourself by Smiting him.  ^.~\n\n-[b]Golemagg[/b] ~ Big health pool (well, for a level 60 raid boss), and a fairly surprising capacity for damage output.  Keep that Shield up, use your Shadowfiend and nuke your heart out.  He takes a little longer than previous bosses.\n\n-[b]Sulfuron[/b] ~ Biggest pain of the whole instance, right here.  Harbinger himself seems content to stand back and toss spears at you.  But he\'s flanked by 4 adds who are Priests themselves. I found the best strat was to simply Mana burn all four of them until they were ooM then take them down.  This takes awhile and strains your own Mana pool...Be prepared to take a beating and run out of Mana on this fight.  Dispersion and Shadowfiend are your friends.\n\n-[b]Executus[/b] ~ Probably the most entertaining fight in here.  Despite having twice the adds as Sulfuron, he\'s not as rough to fight.  Concentrate on taking out the four healer adds first, then the melee adds.  You\'ll constantly get telelported to the fire pit, which both interrupts your spells and forces you to keep moving;  Keep that Shield up and throw those DoTs.  This is another fight where you\'ll take a beating but you should have the Mana to get through just fine.\n\n-[b]Ragnaros[/b] ~ Position yourself at "the spot" at range, in front of the rock wall;  if you get knocked back you won\'t go far, and a couple of lava-hops will put you back into position.

Renew or seal of light will be fine.\n\nBoss 2 - Magmadar - Clear the fire imps prior to his room, and the 2 packs on the right as you look past the dogs to the boss. Sit your healer back at the start of this room just after the fire imps. Tag the boss with your tank and run the wall avoiding all the packs - use fear ward, pally shield, EMFH anything to wipe the fear for one time. Tank and spank, he fears and drops fire on the ground. Fire is negligible damage and fear is just a pain. \n\nBoss 3 - Gehennas - If you can cure curses you are fine to tank and spank. If not, put any form of healing on you, be it priest shields, frenzy regen, seal of light, even warrior\'s regen. His curse kills practically all healing. \n\nBoss 4 - Garr - Pfft tank and spank, pull boss, auto attack, go have a smoke and come back. \n\nBoss 5 - Shazzrah - Put healer at max range. Tank with boss\' back up against wall. Tank and spank. \n\nBoss 6 - Baron Geddon - Pull boss back into Garr\'s area and run up the wall a bit. Fair bit of healing needed on all members. Fire resist is a plus. Long fight. \n\nBoss 7 - Golemag - Has a dot that stacks to 50. With a healer in tow, its easy til the last 10%. The damage gets a bit intense but nothing like the ICC 5 mans, that are current as i write this.\n\nBoss 8 - Sulfuron Harbinger - Pfft tank and spank.

Also, he runs around fast as hell, so be sure not to get caught unprepared for him. I killed him in that little hallway between Barron and Garr.

They are Magic, which Restoration can remove if you have the talent.\n\nMost of the other bosses where just easy as killing random stuff for quests such as the creatures we kill in Molten Front today.

I killed the least amount of trash I could. At level 85, you can simply walk past them (except Core Hounds) and not aggro them.

Rogues and Warriors (execute spam once Vael reaches 20%) deal BOATLOADS of damage at 80, especially well geared 80s). We killed Onyxia and got four cloaks made before going into BWL.\n\nRazorgore - Have the tank grab all the adds and tank in the middle of the room. Have the healer stand on top of the tank and pull healing aggro to get the mobs to the tank. Have a dps kill the blackwing mages ONLY (if you only have 3 people, ignore this role). the last player runs around breaking the eggs with razorgore.\n\nVaelstrasz - Warriors, Rogues, Feral Druids, and DKs are absolutely amazing for this. It could be 3 or 4 manned if you had Warrior/Rogue/Rogue/Shaman (for bloodlust and some heals at the beginning) or possibly even Rogue/Rogue/Blood Death Knight (3-man). Just pop all cooldowns, including Bloodlust. the main tank will be killed 1 minute into the fight, while mana users are targetted and killed really fast with BA. The less mana users the better. As I mentioned earilier, we brought in a fifth member and had one log on an alt making the fight - Warrior/Warrior/Rogue/Shaman/Healadin.\n\nBroodlord Lashlayer - incredibly easy, just stand in a corner so you don\'t get knocked back.\n\nFiremaw - Put on your cloaks for this one. The only semi-difficult drake out of the three, just run out of line of sight when the debuff stacks above 20ish (although I was healing through it successfully at 41 stacks for a bit).\n\nEbonroc - Again, use your cloaks here. Cake, only thing is that he heals himself when he attacks the tank, but dps is so high at level 80 it doesn\'t matter at all, just burn him down.\n\nFlamegor - Another cloak fight. He is the easiest of the three drakes since his special ability is enrage, which can be dispelled by loads of different mechanics now. even if you don\'t dispel it, healing is already super easy in BWL so it isn\'t an issue at all.\n\nChromaggus - In our group - Healadin/Tankadin/Mut Rogue/Elemental Shaman, we got hard mode chrommie (Time lapse breath) and it was hell. We barely managed to kill him after several attempts. The reason we had such a large problem is we didn\'t have enough sand for the whole group so Bronze was always up, Black was always up since we couldn\'t decurse, and Red stacks too high to cleanse effectively so we had to rely on the disease cleansing totem to slowly remove it. So if Chromaggus threw up Blue, Time lapsed, and threw up green, it was GG as most of the party got converted. In the end we finally got it just because he didn\'t end up doing that. Fight took about 10 minutes as he has 2 million hp.\n\nNefarian - significantly easier than chromaggus. some class calls can be annoying, but they aren\'t fight-ending. Adds are cake. with everyone having a cloak, no need to bother with freaking out about shadow flame.\n\nAnd I hope those tips help you and your friends to 4-5 man BWL.

I used barkskin as well as herbalisms Lifeblood to have some extra survivability while being in cat form. The annoying part about being stuck in cat form from being in bear form, was that I couldn\'t use savage roar or berserk after I got the debuff.

I\'d recommend you do the killing because you have a lot of tools to grab aggro on everything so your friend doesn\'t get interrupted (Death and Decay, Blood Boil, Howling Blast for you Frost DKs, etc). Just stick close to your friend and use everything you\'ve got. Once you engage Razorgore, he\'s a joke.\n\nVaelastrasz the Corrupt: This is a very intense DPS race. Vael applies Burning Adrenaline to the tank 45 seconds after you engage him. BA will kill you after fifteen seconds from the moment of application. He has 993k HP. You have 60 seconds to kill him before you die. [b]You must do a minimum of 16550 DPS to kill Vael.[/b] Unfortunately, infinite RP, as nice as it is, isn\'t as great as infinite rage or energy. Still, this is very possible without raiding epics. For my DK\'s DW Frost gear set, it\'s mostly ilvl 346 gear. You\'ll need to pop every CD imaginable to push DPS as high as possible: Army of the Dead, Raise Dead, Flask of Titanic Strength, Golemblood Potion, Pillar of Frost, trinkets, Blood Tap every 30 seconds to give yourself another Death Rune for Obliterate, etc. I did it tonight and when Vael died Recount said I pulled 19898.5 DPS.\n\nSupression room and Broodlord Lashlayer - Suppression aura is going to kill your rune regeneration, but the whelps have only 4-5k HP. You can kill off whelps with a single Decay and Death. The elite dragonkin and orcs die fairly easy for how slow your rune regen will be. If you\'re Frost, drop a Hungering Cold on whelps. Frost Fever alone may kill them and it buys time for runes to come back up. I cleared the last pack of whelps before Broodlord, got out of combat, and changed back to Blood to tank Broodlord. You may be able to zerg Broodlord as DPS, but even in tanking gear with an average ilvl of 349, his Mortal Strike was still hitting for 4k (pretty damn hard hit for a level 60 raid boss on a level 85 tank if you ask me). Tank him with your back against a corner on the gate he\'s protecting; he won\'t knock you back and you won\'t be in Suppression. Other than that, he\'s easy.\n\nFiremaw - Clear the two trash pulls before him and tank him with your back to a corner. Be prepared to pop some CDs when your debuff stacks past 40; it\'ll start ticking for 5-6k at that point. Nothing terribly seriously as long as you keep Death Striking and using CDs right.\n\nEbonroc - His debuff that heals him for 25k per melee attack he lands isn\'t really as dangerous as you might think. Even in tanking gear I didn\'t have a problem outdpsing the healing. After the debuff fades, pop AMS when you can to buy more time to avoid another debuff.\n\nFlamegor - Reduce his HP to zero. It could get a little sticky if you let him knock you back into the three pack of drakknoids before Chromaggus.\n\nChromaggus - Without a way to cleanse any of the debuffs other than Bronze, I wasn\'t able to zerg Chromaggus down in DPS gear before every debuff stacked up and he MC\'d me; got him to 43% before it happened. If you\'re full epics, you MIGHT be able to solo him, but even then, you\'d still have to get very lucky on timing your AMS to gain immunity to a debuff or two. Even then, you\'d likely need full heroic raid gear. You\'ll need to bring a friend that can remove at least one debuff.\n\nNefarian - Obviously got stuck on Chromaggus, but I would imagine that the phase 1 adds die fast (they only have 12k HP iirc). Phase 3 zerg could probably be handled easily by popping Army and hit a few CDs because all those adds hitting you could add up. I can\'t see Nefarian being TOO hard.\n\nBummed out about Chromaggus, but was still loads of fun (and pretty decent gold, too).

At level 85 it would be far easier.\n\nNot only is BWL 2-mannable now, as of 4.01 it doesn\'t even need a tank.  A mage and I (a disc priest) duoed it this evening.  Some of the fights gave us a bit of trouble.\n\nRazorgore - The mage had to control the dragonkin while I looped around the room in a figure 8 jumping off the balconies.  I\'d shield myself to draw aggro from new mobs, and holy nova whenever there were a bunch near me.  I\'d shield the mage each time I passed that side of the room as well.\n\nVael - The mage went arcane so that his arcane blasts when "debuffed" from Vael were doing 90k/blast.  His mirror images messed with Vael\'s aggro so I usually got debuffed first, but it didn\'t matter and we got him anyway.\n\nBroodlord, Firemaw, Flamegor -- easy.  No special notes necessary.\n\nEbonroc -- we had a tough time because our damage couldn\'t outdo his healing.  So we gave ourselves some extra shadow resistance via lesser flasks of resistance and greater shadow resistance cloak enchants.  That was enough so that we resisted some of the debuffs from Ebonroc, so our dps now outdid it healing.  I\'d also save shield for when either of us was debuffed, and I would fade whenever I was debuffed and Ebonroc was attacking me.  It all helped.\n\nChromaggus -- quite nasty.  Once the mage realized he actually did have to decurse it worked fine.  I couldn\'t even begin to keep up with the number of disease debuffs so I ignored him.  (The mage iceblocked eventually to get rid of his stack).  I focused on removing the blue debuff while we both removed the bronze.  In the end we bagged Chromaggus, but it was a close fight.  (We had a number of fire vulnerabilities which helped a great deal).\n\nNefarian -- we wiped several times (once due to an unlucky mind control) before we realized the bulk of our problem was the corrupted healing debuff.  It was significantly increased by my spellpower.  So much so that the mage had a single stack of corrupted healing on him causing him to take 3000+/second damage.  I had nothing that could heal through that and so he died in short order.  His chain polymorphs were doing a number on me as well.\n\nSo we came up with a new strategy.  We kited the adds around the room in a big circle leaving their bodies all over the place (as 45-50 resurrected adds all at once would cause our AoE to be divided up too low to kill them easily).  The mage then hid in the tunnel while I solo\'ed Nef on the other side of the room to 20% (which is easy for a disc priest).  We were far enough away from the mage so that he never did a mage call.  At 20% the mage came out and began AoE\'ing.  He killed a few and my AoE killed a few, at which point I faded and chased after everyone AoE\'ing along the way.  The mage went down but so did 90% of the adds.  I then finished up Nefarian and the adds with no difficulty.\n\nAll in all, quite fun.  Some challenges were easy, some were easy once the strategy became obvious, and others were quite stressful.  Definitely a worthy challenge for a mage/priest team.',1157365,0,'0',0);

If you don\'t have 2 accounts, get a random 60 from trade (or guild) that can use the gear (you might want to reserve the elementium ingots).\nFirst boss is the only place where the 60 is needed, of course. I pull/kill the controller and 2 adds, then place the 60 under the orb hugging the wall and control the boss (it\'s pretty important not to place him on the platform since that\'s where the mobs go first). When adds start coming, I run around with my (ret) paladin spamming divine storm, and tabbing back to the 60 every 10 seconds to destroy the next egg. I rarely have problems with MC dropping before the debuff fades. I suppose the healing from divine storm is a godsend for this as it aggro\'s mobs from the other side of the room.\n\nSecond boss is easy as long as you can pull enough dps. The boss has 990k health but you get an infinite rage/energy/rp buff and another 100% damage buff shortly into the fight that kills you if you take too long. It helps to have the alt be able to rez you after the fight (yay Mass Resurrection).\n\nSuppression room is annoying, I usually suicide my alt at the beginning and then mass rez him from after I kill the boss.\n\nNext rooms are packed with mobs that drop elementium ingots, which can yield decent cash on AH. The dragons are quite easy except for the second one (Ebonroc), which places a debuff on you that heals the boss for a large amount every time you get hit. Avoidance is really nice here if you can get it, otherwise you would need pretty good dps to burn through the healing.\n\nChromaggus is really tough, especially for classes that can\'t cleanse. He regularly places one of 5 debuffs on you that last 10 minutes. Four are dispellable by normal means (poison, disease, magic and curse) and one is only removable with sands of time that drop from mobs in previous rooms (you would need like 10 of these). The debuffs themselves aren\'t that bad (healing reduction and periodic stuns are perhaps the most dangerous), but once you get all 5 you get mind controlled, effectively resetting the boss. The boss also has much higher health than the previous ones - 1.8M, and is pretty tough on selfhealing (at least for me, I need to bubble to reset disease stacks, LoH and use wog a lot).\n\nNefarian, on the other hand, is quite easy. After you talk to him on the throne adds start coming, and don\'t stop until you kill 42 of them. You can either hide the alt behind the throne so he won\'t die from shadow flame, or suicide him (I got mind controlled by adds once, the boss despawned and didn\'t come back until I ran out of the instance). Once adds are down nefarian is a joke (though might be annoying depending on your class call. It helps to keep the alt alive since he might eat some of the class calls. At 20% all adds from phase 1 revive as skeletons with low health, aoe them down, otherwise they don\'t hurt much.',1434025,0,'0',0);

I\'d like to add a comment on the importance of securing and defending forward based graveyards to winning AV. If your goal is to down Drek then taking Frostwolf Graveyard should be your top priority. Forget about taking other graveyards along the way (except maybe Snowfall because it\'s easy to take). Trying to take every graveyard on your way to Drek results in an offense that gets spread out thin. The thinned out offense ends up getting easily killed by a few Horde players fighting along side Elite NPCs and when our offense, failing to capture any forward based graveyards, respawns back near Dun Baldar Alliance players find themselves on the wrong side of the Horde offense. Next thing you know instead of having a 30man offense/10man defense you have a 10man offense/30man defense with everyone arguing and talking about the good ol days when alliance used to own AV.\n\nAs a lvl 60 feral Druid it\'s easy for me to start taking over a graveyard with just one other player. I cast my two HoT spells get into bear form and pull the NPCs from the graveyard banner leaving it open for the other player working with me to assault. Being able to heal myself, and having 11k armor, the NPCs give up chasing me before they kill me. \n\nIf you have 5+ people (hopefully one tank and one healer) you should be able to kill the NPCs and the Elite NPC. With 5+ people what you shouldnt do is have 1 person pull while everyone else runs to the banner. Why? Because the one person pulling gets killed, the NPCs return and your still working on the banner, the banner opens up right after the NPCs gang bang 1 or 2 more of your party members, the last few either die trying to counter attack or run away. Then as your spirit sits waiting to respawn back at Dun Baldar the message pops up letting you know that Horde has defended the graveyard you just assaulted\n\nAlso until the graveyard is won it should be heavily guarded so some Horde doesn\'t spend 2 seconds undoing all your hard work.\n\nAs a side note, if you find yourself as a spirit back at a GY near Dun Baldar and theres an Alliance GY up where your O is, walk your spirit to that GY and respawn there. Its slower than riding a mount but unless your destination GY is lost on your walk there its a sure thing!\n\nthat was longer than I thought it would be',50672,0,'0',0);

We want to emphasize this in Alterac Valley more and give players additional meaning to both defending and attacking. To push the strategic element of the battleground to the next level we have changed how players maintain their reinforcements or deprive the other team of theirs.\n\nEach team will have a starting reinforcement count. Reinforcements can be lost in significant amounts if a tower is destroyed or if Captain Galvangar or Balinda Stonehearth is killed. For each team member death, an additional reinforcement will be lost. On the death of General DrekThar or Vanndar Stormpike, all reinforcements are lost and the team is defeated. At any point in time, if a team is reduced to zero reinforcements, the opposing team will win the battle. Defending your own teammates, towers, and key NPCs will be an important aspect of maintaining team resources and achieving victory in Alterac Valley.\n\nWarmasters can be the boon or the bane of any team. They are an important element for the defense of your general or the defeat of the opposing general. Warlords and their general will be more closely linked in the next patch. Pulling one is a guarantee the other will come as well. Each team begins with four Warmasters. Destroying a tower will eliminate the associated Warmaster. Unlike the current game play, however, destroying the enemy tower will not add a Warmaster to your own side.\n\nWe will be changing the pace of the battle slightly with a reduction in the time needed to control a tower or graveyard. Where it currently takes five minutes to gain control, the time will be reduced to four minutes. The honor for capturing a tower will also be increased.\n\nGraveyards can be an important resource for getting your teammates back into the battle more quickly. Currently, players can sometimes be sent to their starting tunnels far from the battlefront. This can often be an inconvenient location to respawn and more out of the way from the action than we would like, to correct this, players will instead respawn at a team-controlled graveyard. Should the team not have a graveyard under their control, they will respawn in the starting tunnel.\n\nPlayers will only be awarded bonus honor during the battle for destroying enemy towers and slaying the enemy Captain. Once the battle is concluded, bonus honor will be awarded for intact towers, a surviving Captain, and for victory in battle. The bonus honor awarded should be similar to previous totals, but will reward players for taking more active roles in Alterac Valley toward defending or attacking key locations and NPCs.\n\nLastly, we are changing NPC interactions within Alterac Valley. We have reduced the number of elite NPCs in Stormpike and Frostwolf holds as well as sent all Commanders and Lieutenants out of Alterac Valley. They are currently in search of other battle opportunities. This should reduce the amount of NPCs that players will have to fight and place more focus on PvP combat over key locations on the map.\n\nStrategy is the name of the game in Alterac Valley, and these changes will bring out the need for more teamwork and coordination from both the Horde and the Alliance as they vie for domination of this battleground.',181675,0,'0',0);

Anyway, at each of those winning rounds, we had usually only max 1-2 towers destroyed, no graveyards lost and our captain were also alive in about 75% of those rounds, we had 1 Wing Commander returned, and we had captured about 1 or two of their towers, both mines and killed their captain.. The result each round was 0 reinforcements to the enemy faction, but we were also pretty close, we usually went down to 40-100 before they reached 0. Anyone else got this in the current patch at higher lvl BG queues? Seems to me that the xp in BGs are boosted  alittle again, and yes i have the chest and shoulder heirloom.\n\nSorry for all the text though.\n\nEdit: Just noticed, i only receive around 10-40% exp each winning round now at most, no matter what many assets we have, this is though in the 61-70 brackets, but i do think i got the same value in the 51-60 bracket one or two times at lvl 52, when it was not Call to Arms, i think i might have been a little blind to not realize that Call to Arms that week had any experience effect, i have always thougt that CtA only gave more honor.

It is in my opnion, the battleground that needs a revamp the hardest.  \n\nA breif explanation of the older contents:  \n\nTokens from killed players or enemy NPC\'s used to be used for different raid buffs from sending extra elite troops, Air raids, and an epic boss that would assault the opposing base if the right amount of tokens were colleted.  I cannot recall but Ive only seen the boss twice in the game myself.  One was of elemental type (horde) and the other was a giant trent (allies)\nEach time a player was killed by this boss (if i remember correctly) the summonable raid boss would get bigger and heal a little bit.  you had to protect the boss till it could survive on its own but after it got big enough it was devastating and a wonder to behold.  \n\nWhat happens nowadays (on nightfall battlegroup)\n\nAllies first cap snowfall (correct me if Im wrong on names of places pls) the neutrel grave in the center of the map.  Then they assault the secondary raid boss that provides a group buff to the horde, then they take each tower and grave the rest of the way.  If Im right each tower still in place provides an extra elite to defend the respective general so towers are important.  Remember that each grave cap reduces travel time to the opposeing gerneral so they cap those as much as possible as well.  \n\nAllies useing this tend to win AV alot.  Horde tends to try and race them and that often does not work very well.\n\nThe horde attempt for the most part to mirrior the allies tatic and they tend to fail for whatever reason.  What I have noticed is that when horde tries to defend and recap horde often gets enough time to assualt and defeat the alliance general.  Provided that the defence works in coordinated (rarely) groups horde tends to win.  \n\nThings that would fix/restore the old AV:\n\nI would like to see the tokens usefulness restored.  An inrease to reinforcements through tokens?  or maybe just an increase to reinforcements period might make the tokens a valid option agian.  Beefing up the bosses to where the tokens are needed to win would be very cool imo.  There is never any straight conflict because both sides see it as just a DPS race.\n\nIt would be even funnier if they decided to make the generals leave to assault the other base after a given timelimit.

Instead of posting individually on each of the rare spawns, I decided to post here to clear a few things up. \n\nFirst thing to realize is that The Maul, the area inside Dire Maul where the rare spawns appear, is a FFA PvP arena. This is the same as the Gurubashi Arena in STV, you can kill anybody inside regardless of faction, as long as they are not in your group. What this means to you: If you come across somebody already killing a rare spawn, just look at it as an opportunity... Allow them to drop the boss to 20%, deal some amount of damage to the boss and make easy work of the player. The tag becomes yours, and the player cannot corpse run back in time to do anything about it. Enjoy your ninja\'d loots.\n\nNext we need to identify our rare spawns. There are a total of three, they are Mushgog, The Razza, and Skarr the Unbreakable. I know FOR A FACT that the spawn timer is not the 2-4 days, or even 3-4 hours that everybody thinks it  is. How do I know this? Well I killed Skarr and logged out at The Maul, and after logging in 10 minutes later I found The Razza waiting peacefully for his death. There was another occurence when I was fighting either Razza or Skarr [Can\'t remember] and Mushgog spawned DURING the fight. On another occasion, I arrived at The Maul where Razza and Mushgog were both already spawned at the same time. As you may have gathered, this shows that the three bosses are on seperate spawn timers that are not related to eachother at all. As for the individual spawn timers, I cannot say exactly how long it is possible for one boss to spawn back to back, but the closest I\'ve seen was about 17 hours.\n\nWell this is becoming a bit lengthy, so I\'ll just leave it at that. I plan on making guides for each boss, so look for them in the next for weeks. I\'ll also post a comment on Griniblix the Spectator, I\'m currently collecting information to try and see if the things he shouts have any relation with the bosses that spawn next, or the time when they spawn.',75657,0,'0',0);

Hopefully this will help those of the Alliance to find the dungeon without dying and give the lower level player info to help them through the dungeon. \n\n[b]If you are Alliance.[/b] I just ran this dungeon last night with my level 85 arms warrior with a gear level of 312.  I would not advise doing this with a toon that is much lower than level 80 due to the difficulty of getting [i][b]to[/b][/i] the dungeon. If you try it at a lower level and have average gear (not epic), at least use caution and get help from a few higher level players (like level 85). This city is three levels high. There are level 85 soldiers on the ground level and high level archers on the top two levels. It may seem like there are not many soldiers around, but the archers are hiding above you and they WILL get you! Orcs and Horde don\'t understand when Alliance just want to go in and complete the dungeon for the achievement and not kill anyone in the city, or they understand and just want to stop you regardless. I would advise not fighting your way to the dungeon. That would flag you as pvp and you will end up attracting more attention that you want. Really, the run is not as bad as it may seem [i][b]IF[/b][/i] you are prepared for it. \n\nOrgrimmar has a back entrance, well actually it\'s more of a side entrance. The side entrance is on the left side of the city (if you are facing the city). I flew in and landed far enough away from the gate that I wouldn\'t attract any attention. I tried to land inside the city where I felt there weren\'t many soldiers and got shot off my bird. That\'s when I discovered the archers!  So, I would advise just running in through the side gate. Get on your swift horse and be prepared to run as fast as you can. No hesitations so be careful you don\'t miss anything or get stuck on a pole or such with your horse. Lol! \n\n[b]Here\'s the route to the dungeon:  [/b]Run straight through the gate and down the path. When you come to the circle, take the left side and circle around. The path picks back up on the other side of the circle. Continue down the path and you will see that it goes through a tunnel of sorts. Go through the tunnel. At the end of the tunnel take a left and the entrance to the Cleft of Shadow is on your right almost immediately. It\'s easy to miss because it\'s just a slit in the rock, but don\'t miss it because by now you have an army of soldiers following you.  Once you are in the cleft, follow the path around and you\'ll get to some buildings. If you look ahead a bit, you\'ll see the instance off a little bit to the right and further ahead. You\'ll have to weave to your left a bit then run down a ramp and curve to your right a bit. You should be able to see the instance clearly by now. Just run straight through it. The soldiers don\'t follow you, so you can stop and heal after you get inside. \n\n[b]Once inside the instance[/b], if you simply want a quick run for the achievement and you are level 80 or above, you can probably just run straight to the middle of the dungeon and get the final boss and be done with it. It\'s only a level 15 dungeon, so the mobs won\'t hurt you much.  To find the final boss, pull up your map. When you pull it up it has a map of the dungeon (very nice btw Blizzard!). You see three marked bosses - one in the middle and two further on. Believe it or not, the one in the middle is the final boss and the only one you need to get to complete the dungeon. Personally, I\'m a looter. I am not one of those rich 85 players and I can always use as many goods as I can get. There are a lot of green and blue items in there. Granted they are level 15 or so, but you can still sell them, and some you can give to lower level toons if you have any. \n\n[b]For the lower level players who want to clear the entire dungeon[/b]:\n1. Follow the map carefully once inside the instance. \n2. There are doorways where it looks like there are none so they can be easy to miss. \n3. There are dead ends that have quite a few mobs. Two of them can be found at the beginning of the dungeon, one off to each side through a dark entrance. \n4. When pulling mobs, it\'s almost impossible to pull them one at a time. They usually come in twos and threes, and there is usually a caster of some sort that stands off and shoots spells at you (in addition to the other three) so plan accordingly. I usually just pulled out my gun and shot one of the mobs and the other two ran over to me. \n5. For players who are doing this dungeon at the correct level or slightly above it, there are a lot of really good green and blue items to loot here, so I would advise clearing everything and being careful not to miss anything! \n6. There are a lot of bridges crossing over lava, so again, be sure to use your map so you don\'t keep circling around. It is a pretty straight forward simple set up for a dungeon, so no worries. \n7. The final boss, Taragaman the Hungerer, is all alone. I was quite surprised at this since you never seem to find the big boss all alone. The other two bosses have two mobs around them and a few more wandering around before them alone, but if you pull one you generally pull both. \n\nSince I did this as a level 85, I really can\'t explain how the bosses fight. All it took was one hit form me and they were gone. So, sorry, no mechanics explanation here I\'m afraid. \n\nHope this helps some of you! Have fun!',1378400,0,'0',0);

It was really challenging, took over 1 hour to finish. My pet was a cat.\n\nThe trick to do this was to kite most mobs through the entire dungeon, from their starting location to the entrance of the dungeon and trying to keep http://DBURLHERE/?spell=136 Mend Pet  up most of the time while there was only 2 mobs. I had to die many times due to no more kiting space when there was more than 2 mobs.\n\nWhen I reached the part of the troggs, I let my pet attack 1 mob for the entire time while I kited the 2 other ones, always letting my pet focus and tank the http://DBURLHERE/?npc=11319 shaman  ones, so they couldn\'t heal the mobs I was kiting. I kept http://DBURLHERE/?spell=1130 Hunter\'s Mark  up on the mob I was focusing and always using http://DBURLHERE/?spell=5116 Concussive Shot , and when the one I wasn\'t focusing reached melee range, http://DBURLHERE/?spell=2974 Wing Clipped  it and resumed kiting.\n\nFor http://DBURLHERE/?npc=11517 Oggleflint , I had to die 1 time so I could get at least the shaman down. Then, when I went back to resume the fight, I let my pet tanking Oggleflint while I kited and killed the other one. By the time the http://DBURLHERE/?npc=11318 trogg  was dead, my pet was dead as well, so I had to kite Oggleflint to his death. Keeping Hunter\'s Mark, http://DBURLHERE/?spell=1978 Serpent\'s Sting  and Concussive Shot up all the time, I kited him back and forth from his starting location to the entrance of the dungeon. When I was close to the entrance, I let Serpent\'s Sting fall off so I could http://DBURLHERE/?spell=19503 Scatter Shot  him and turn the other way around, until he was dead. I proceeded killing the worms and elementals in my way until I reached the orc mobs.\n\nI ALWAYS let my pet tanking the http://DBURLHERE/?npc=11323 enforcer  while I kited the http://DBURLHERE/?npc=11322 cultist , so I wouldn\'t have to worry much about the stun from the enforcer and the damage from http://DBURLHERE/?spell=18266 Curse of Agony  was really low so I didn\'t care about it. When there was a http://DBURLHERE/?npc=11324 warlock , I kited the cultist or enforcer while my pet was tanking the warlock so I wouldn\'t have to take all the damage from http://DBURLHERE/?spell=20791 Shadow Bolt , which hits for about 34 damage and it was quite high compared to my health at the moment. Also always killing patrols alone and waiting for them to go away before I engaged a group of mobs.\n\nFor http://DBURLHERE/?npc=11520 Taragaman , I first let my pet tank him using http://DBURLHERE/?spell=19577 Intimidation , Mend pet and http://DBURLHERE/?spell=34026 Kill Command  until my pet was dead, then I proceeded kiting Taragaman through the entire instance, just like Oggleflint.\n\nDoing the same kiting for the group of 3 orcs before Jergosh, I let my pet tank the enforcer while I focused the other enforcer and using Wing Clip on the cultist.\n\nNow for http://DBURLHERE/?npc=11518 Jergosh , it was hard, because I had to kite him and another orc while my pet was tanking the third orc. The difficulty here was that I had to kite both the boss and the orc, meaning that I would have to Concussive shot Jergosh and Wing Clip the orc because the boss hit me for over 120 damage, and I had 479 health. I had to die twice for both of the adds deaths, so I could do the same thing I did with Oggleflint, kiting him. The main problem was that Jergosh would sometimes cast http://DBURLHERE/?spell=20800 Immolate , which could kill me even if he didn\'t touch me. I also had to pop a http://DBURLHERE/?item=858  Lesser Healing Potion .\n\nhttp://DBURLHERE/?npc=11519 Bazzalan  was the same thing as Jergosh, except that it was easier. I let my pet tank both Bazzalan and one cultist at the same time, so I could kill the cultist I was focusing with ease. By the time my target was dead, my pet was dead too, so I Wing Clipped the orc and focused him while used Concussive Shot on Bazzalan whenever it was off cooldown, then proceeded kiting Bazzalan the same way I did with the others, but here I only kited him through his starting place to the start of the way to him, so I didn\'t have to waste too much time.\n\nIn the end, I got 2 levels, 1 from killing the mobs and the other 1 from the quests, plus 2 gold from just looting and vendoring, not including the items I could sell at the auction house. It was a pretty fun challenge, not something I would do again so soon. Hope this helps fellow hunter trying to solo this place as well.\n\nEDIT: Fixed some spell names and added links.',1472608,0,'0',0);

Pick something small like a gryphon, not a mount that anyone without 100 miles would notice as being Alliance.\n\nWhen you get to Orgrimmar City, hover high above and get yourself oriented. Be sure to be high enough to be out of range of the flying patrols etc. Once you see where you are, just hover over the area where the west side entrace to Cleft of Shadows is. Drop down enough to be sure, but stay up enough to not aggro flying patrols.\n\nOnce you see no one is noticing you, just swoop down into the Cleft and continue east and down to the right a bit. You will NOT be dismounted, and if you do aggro a patrol, you\'ll easily get to the instance and fly into it without taking any noticable damage. It took me no more than 15s to swoop down into the cleft and hit the instance entrance.\n\nHorde would have to camp the actual entrance, and even then I doubt it matters.

After we decided to take the front entrance (contrary to everyone else\'s view), we stripped down and went running. I died a total of 16 times while he died a total of seven trying to get inside the dungeon.

Clear out the 5 lodges and then click the barrels inside. The first boss comes after you set them on fire so make sure you drink up and buff up before setting the last explosive. He is a warrior so melee DPS, watch for the whirlwind and run away (strafe, not back peddle) from it so you don\'t take a 2k hit. Priests, watch for the mortal strike and be ready on those shields if it brings your tank low on hp. If he fears and goes after a caster, drag him to your tank who will be immobilized.\n\nStep 2: Rescue Thrall.\nGo into the keep at the top of the hill and clear into the basement. Everyone turn in your first quest and take his second. Once you have buffed Thrall and everyone has his quest, talk to him again and start the escort. BEWARE, once you start Thrall doesn\'t stop. During each fight, casters, position yourselves between the mobs you are killing, and the ones you will be killing next and do NOT loot after the fight. Immediately start drinking when the last mob goes down. Melee, bandage up cause those casters aren\'t getting much of a break at all and need to drink. After about 4 waves, you will get to the gates and the next boss will come in. Enjoy your first break while he and Thrall chat, but its a short one. He comes with 2 adds that need to be killed first. The boss is a pally so watch for the stuns and heals.\n\nStep 3: Go to Tarren Mill.\nNOBODY TALK TO THRALL. Rebuff and heal and mana up before talking to Thrall. He will hop on the horse and ride off to Tarren Mill. He will first stop in the barn, then the chapel and finnaly the inn. You will have to fight a wave of mobs at each place. Remember, Thrall doesn\'t like to stop so casters again position yourselves between the stuff you are fighting and where you are heading so you can drink and not have nearly as far to run. Once you clear the inn, you will find Taretha. Again, NOBODY TALK TO THRALL OR TARETHA until you are all buffed, healed, and full mana. Talk to Taretha and start the final event\n\nStep 4: The Infinity Dragon Flight.\nRun back outside and in front of the chapel. You will have 3 waves of dragonkin and then the last boss. The first wave has 2 melee and 1 caster dragonkin. They come from in front of the chapel. The next wave will come from the left (facing away from the chapel). This will be an identical wave. Once the last one dies, you will get a wave of 4 from where the first wave spawned (3 melee and 1 caster). The Melee will mortal strike so priests, have those shields ready for when they get MSed. THe casters will cast corruption, shadow bolt, and a curse that increases damage taken. Druids and Mages need to decurse that ASAP. Hunters, you will want to be proactive in your traps to get one that is incoming. Go to where the mobs will be coming from and drop the trap before that wave even spawns. Priests, drop shields on your tanks just before the last thing dies in that wave. You will have little time to drink between these waves. Druids, you will most likely want to hibernate the caster mobs. Also if you aren\'t tanking, you need to go back by the chapel steps between waves. And finaly, fear is your friend here. Priests/Locks, you AE fear will be really nice when your tank is trying to pick up those 3 melee on the last wave. Do them a favor and fear them off so you can get a chance to get them under control.\n\nThe boss is also kinda tough. He has Garr\'s anti magic pulse that will eat your buffs, he has an Dot that deals shadow damage. He has a knock back so tank him up against a wall. And finally, like all dragons, he has a breath weapon, but since you are tanking him against the wall, nobody but the tank should be getting hit.  I would highly recomend a warrior or druid tank over a paladin.  Pallies will suffer from their righteous fury constantly being dispelled and so they will have a harder time holding aggro.',28781,0,'0',0);

This instance neatly segregates all of the pulls for the first part of the instance, and then forcefeeds the rest to you via Thrall\'s event. It\'s pretty hard to foul up a pull here. The pats are obnoxious but there\'s almost nothing you can really do about them.\n\nMobs:\n\nTarren Mill/Durnholde:\nSentries - Two-hander swinging melee units. Hit for 450-750 a whack on plate. Become kittens when disarmed. Just keep them off cloth and you\'re gold.\n\nProtectors: Annoying. Drops HoJ regularly, heals, hits. Adjust accordingly when your tank gets the hammer.\n\nRiflemen: Holy Jesus I hate these bastards. Worst mob in the whole instance. Corral them into melee range or they\'ll perforate your whole party with multishot or scattershot your tank repeatedly. Oh yeah, they also sting, but that\'s not nearly as wipe-inducing as the damn scattershot. Cleanse cleanse cleanse.\n\nWarden: Second worst enemy in the instance. Stun/kick/slam/silence these because they psychic scream and heal other units. They drop Power Word: Pain as well, but the psychic screams and heals are the real reason these need to go down first. Between scattershots from the riflemen and the screams here, it can be insanely frustrating to tank this place.\n\nVeteran: Rogue or Fury Warrior type. Duel-wields and hits fast. I have no idea what class they\'re supposed to be since I don\'t recall them ever using any skills that I noticed. Nothing special.\n\nMages: Annoying but since mages telegraph all their spells like nothing else keeping them silenced/kicked/bashed/stunned is pretty simple. They also sheep, so watch for that.\n\nInfinite Dragonflight Trash:\nSlayer/Saboteur: Generic meleers. Same old same old. Keep off cloth, shield block, disarm, etc.\n\nInfinite Defiler: Warlock, casts corruption, curses, etc. Dispell the curses and take these down ASAP while the tank keeps the melee tied up.\n\nBosses:\n\nDrake: a souped up sentry. OG WoW players will find themselves screaming "BLADES OF LIGHT!" during this fight. He fears, uses Herod\'s trademark whirlwind, mortal strikes, etc. Hits harder than the sentries. If you\'re melee and not the tank, back off when the whirlwind starts. The fear is annoying, but the tank is rooted in place for it so drag drake back to him so he can reestablish aggro. Tank n\' spank.\n\nSkarloc: Souped up protector. Heals, hammers, cleanses, comes with 2 adds. Smoke the adds, then smoke Skarloc. Tank and spank all the way.\n\nEpoch Hunter: A dragon, only without a fear and a pretty middling breath weapon that slows you down. To be honest I barely noticed this guy doing anything else. I just tanked and kept him turned away from the group and everything was just dandy.\n\nShort Progression:\n1. Grab explosives from NPC, fly to Durnholde\n2. Do old-fashioned pulls to the pit, hop in.\n3. Clear houses and plant explosives.\n4. When the last one is planted, everything blows and Drake shows up. Mangle him.\n5. Go back up to the castle, clear it, talk to thrall.\n6. Chase after thrall while he barrels into several waves of mobs, swear profusely.\n7. When you exit Durnholde, Skarloc shows up. Mangle him too.\n8. Rebuff/drink/breathe. Chat up Thrall and follow him to Tarren Mill. Chat at Tarren Mill to start the last bit.\n9. Again protect Thrall has he brings down an army on you in the barn, the church, and then the inn. Chat up the girl when you\'re good to go.\n10.

As you move forward in the instance you will see Medivh surrounded by a red casting effect. The event will start the minute you get near Medivh, so avoid him until your group has cleared a good distance around Medivh of all three types of mobs. This gives you and your party room to move safely about during the event.\n\nOnce cleared of crocs, spiders, and cats make sure you are full-buffed and have your consumeables ready. Move close to Medivh to start the event. On the top center of your screen you will see a percentage of remaining shield left on Medivh and a Rift Status Counter. Your objective is to keep Medivh\'s shield from reaching zero percent and destroy what comes through each of the 18 Rifts. \n\nRift 1/18 will spawn somewhere in the woods surrounding Medivh. First, an elite Rift Keeper will come out and channel a spell near the Rift to keep it open. As long as the Rift Keeper is alive, the Rift stays open. As long as the rift stays open, more non-elite dragonflight will spawn from the Rift and head towards Medivh. One person in your party is to crowd control the non-elites and prevent them from hitting Medivh. Your main tank is always on the Rift Keeper until it dies. The Rift Keeper is channeling, mind you, so your party moves to each Rift as they spawn and tanks them there. Slay the Rift Keeper and finish the non-elites. There is time to drink between each Rift if you do this efficiently and quickly. \n\nEach Rift will spawn somewhere in the woods surrounding Medivh. Rinse repeat with the elite Rift Keeper and non-elites.\n\nHowever, there will be Bosses on Rift number 6, 12, and finally Rift 18. Non-elites will continue to spawn from the rifts as these are open so continue preventing them from reaching Medivh. After each boss kill there is a significantly longer time to res dead, drink, or prepare.\n\nBoss explanation\n\n1st Boss - Casts a magical slowing debuff (dispellable). Aoe knockback. Spank and tank.\n2nd Boss - Puts a debuff on your main tank (much like Kurinaxx) that reduces healing effects by 10% each stack. Obviously, this is a very heavy dps fight so you burn him as fast as possible. This is the only time when your crowdcontrol does not crowdcontrol and instead does damage to the boss. \n3rd Boss - Hits like a truck and uses Time Stop (Much like Chromaggus). If you are a healer, you will get time-stopped and your tank will drop health fast. Shielding when time-stop wears off is efficient and as are HoT\'s (Heal over Time [renew, rejuv, regrowth]). No non-elites come out of the 18th Rift so your crowdcontrol should be dps\'ing. \n\nAfter the 3rd boss is down, you are done with Black Morass.

He did not seem much different from the normal version besides this.\n     1(c)  The last boss did not have anything different that I or any of my party members noticed.\n\n     2)  The Executioners that come in portals 7-11 and 13-17 have a large amount of life.  I heard about 20K.  The mage and warlock type ads have nearly the same amount of life but just hit harder.\n\n     3)  You will benefit from the beacons most if they are used on portals 13-17.  These can have executioners coming out frequently and these mobs can easily overwhelm you quickly because of their health.\n\nI am a hunter and ran with 2 groups in 2 days.  Both days had warriors equipped to tank bosses in SSC.  The healers were a holy priest with 1100 healing and a druid wih 1400 healing.  Other than me, there was a mage/warlock combo and a rogue/shadow priest combo,.  The first day our lock was taking care of the ads and was able to take care of everything pretty easily except the executioners.  The second day I (hunter) did the ads.  I was able to take care of them as well with some helping DPS on the last mob from the portal except the executioners.\n\nIf you have noticed a pattern it is the executioners.  They hit me wearing mail for about 300-400 so they aren\'t that bad damage wise.  We found the best way to deal with these is to have one DPS step off the rift keeper and help the main ad guy with these mobs until they die.  As said above, in portals 7-11 and 13-17 the first ad to come out WILL be an Executioner.  Portals 7-11 will most likely only give you 1 executioner unless your DPS is too slow because you are still getting 3 whelping ad groups.\n\nThe beacons are best used in my experience to be placed on rifts 13-17.  These rifts spawn only solo ads, as such there is a higher chance to get executioners and you can get overwhelmed not because you can\'t kill them, but because you will not be able to get out of combat between rifts because the mobs have too much health.  By having the dragons and 1 person DPSing the rift keepers until the dragon is gone will allow about 2 or 3 ads to come out total.\n\nI hope this helps some of you complete this instance without having to have a couple warm up tries before completing it.',113612,0,'0',0);

You\'re probably thinking "what am I supposed to do, what are the adds like," and other apprehensions along those lines. Well, I\'m going to try and make your add duty run as smoothly as possible. \n\nNote: This is based off normal mode. I don\'t know how different things are in Heroic.\n\nFirst thing you need to know is that the adds spawn at a decently fast rate, around one every 15 seconds or so, but die very fast. As a frost mage, I was able to kill them and have around 5 seconds to prepare for the next spawn. The adds will not attack, and will just move toward Medivh until you attack them. There also seems to be an order in which the adds spawn. Finally, every 6 waves, or after every boss, the types of adds that spawn change, as well as the order they spawn in.\n\nThe Adds\nInfinite Assassin: Spawn during waves 1-12. They have around 5500 HP, and hit cloth for around 250. They also use Sinister Strike for added damage, and Kidney Shot for a 3 second stun. Just nuke them down.\n\nInfinite Whelp: Spawn in groups of 3, during waves 1-12. They only have about 2400 HP, and hit cloth for ~70. No special abilities, and can be easily AoE\'d down, or taken down one by one. \n\nInfinite Chronomancer: Spawn during all waves. They have around 4400 HP, and are casters. There are two types of them: they can either cast Frostbolt for around 1000 damage and slow, or cast Arcane Bolts extremely quickly (close to 1 cast per second) for 800 each. The Arcane Bolt type is a pain to deal with if you miss interrupting its casts.\n\nInfinite Executioner: Spawn during waves 7-17. Have around 5500 HP, hit cloth for around 250, and use Cleave. Straightforward mob, just nuke it down.\n\nInfinite Vanquisher: Spawn during waves 13-17. Have around 5500 HP, and casts spells. There are also two types of these adds: one can cast Scorch for around 800 damage, and one can cast Shadow Bolt for 1000 damage. Their Scorch casts pretty slowly; slower than the normal mage\'s Scorch.\n\nThe order in which they spawn for each wave (or at least what I observed) is:\n\nWaves 1-6: Assassin, Whelps, Chronomancer\nWaves 7-12: Executioner, Chronomancer, Whelps, Assassin (if the rift lord isn\'t dead by then)\nWaves 13-17: Executioner, Vanquisher, Chronomancer\nNo adds spawn during wave 18.\n\nWhat To Do During Bosses:\nFor Chrono-Lord Deja, just continue handling the adds as normal, and just throw a cast at him occasionally.\n\nFor Temporus, what I usually do is stop attacking adds for the fight and just all-out dps on him. After he\'s at around 10% and adds are piling up at Medivh, I run back and drop a beacon on Medivh to clean them up. However, if you have an off-tank, this may not be necessary.\n\nNo adds spawn during Aeonus, so no need to worry here.',132700,0,'0',0);

I don\'t know if their appearance is random or not, but can tell what they do based on their apperance and the weapon they\'re carring:\n\nRift Lord 1: The easiest elite of the 4 elites, by my opinion. It looks like a meele dragon carrying a polearm. Does a small stun and a Mortal Strike on its current target, be it tank or misfortunate DPS.\n\nRift Lord 2: This elite mob is a nightmare for a team with a lot of meele DPS. The reason why is because it does a thunderclap that damages players that are around 20 yards or close to him (estimated damage is 3.5k damage in heroic mode, someone check if this damage is likewise in normal mode). Also does a sunder armor on the current target he is attacking. Looks like a meele dragon, but carrying an axe that looks the same as the arcanite reaper ( http://DBURLHERE/?item=12784 http://DBURLHERE/?item=12784  )\n\nRift Keeper 1: This one is also easy, but harder than the Rift Lord 1. It resembles a caster dragon carrying a Bringer of Death ( http://DBURLHERE/?item=31308 http://DBURLHERE/?item=31308  ). Does either a fear on a meele attacker or a shadow damage AOE that hits all players, even in different ranges ( please smebody confirm is there is any maximum range on this ability please )\n\nRift Keeper 2: This one is, in my opinion, the worst of all the 4 elites. It\'s a caster dragon carrying a staff with a red stone on the staff\'s head. It fires a frostbolt that reduces the target\'s speed, a firebolt that also aplies a short dot on the player, a blast wave of fire damage that affects all meele DPS ( and nearby casters) and a polymorph that affects any meele DPS besides the tank (someone confirm if he sheeps the tank if no DPS is close to the mob, please).

One or two spawns are fine, just have the other people in the group kill them while waiting without expending a lot of mana.\n\nAffliction warlocks have a very easy time with the dragonkin spawns during the standard rifts. As shouldn\'t be said, have them pop a few DoT\'s on the rift lord to maximize DPS, and then have them be focusing on the spawns. If you have a warlock and a mage in your party, it\'s more beneficial to the group to have the mage be on rift lord DPS - unless the warlock gets polymorphed.\n\nDuring boss fights, focus all of your DPS on the boss. The first boss fight - rift 6, Chrono Lord Deja - requires no use of Chrono-beacon. It\'s just a simple burn on the boss. You have a lot of time in between the boss rift and the following rift. Re-buff here if necessary (shouldn\'t be) and make sure to be at full health and mana, preferably mounted waiting for the next rift.\n\nThe second boss fight - rift 12, Temporus - is a cakewalk with a protection warrior.

Doing so means a clear line of sight for you on the spawn point for adds, I often find I get an attack cursor slightly before they appear (we\'re talking fractionally before) and I can get the pet sent off. The main being to one side also means that the pet\'s less likely to get caught by those who AoE and therefore avoid stray damage and not go all psycho on the main.\nI\'ve never needed to DPS on the bosses or the mains (on 2nd boss I take the adds still) except for the odd MD onto the tank at the start of a fight before the adds spawn.  Found this especially helpful if you have main DPS without a threat meter!\n\nOccasionally someone will pull an add or something will get in my  way getting LoS on an add (usually the main mob!) and I\'ll have one spawn before the previous one is dealt with. If the current spawn\'s whelps I\'ll leave them meleeing me and kick off on the next mob, allow the trap to do its damage and then go back to the whelps if they\'re still alive (they hit for nothing so can be ignored in melee). If it\'s something other than whelps I\'ll try to get agg from both onto the pet, knock out a heal and kill one then the other. I\'ve used both a cat and a wind serpent to do the job and both work well. I think I prefer the WS as it can pull nicely with lighting breath (I use it in my macro or trigger manually). Shadow resist def helps the pet on the mains that shadow volley and avoidance helps avoid the AoE\'s if they catch the pet. I\'ve sometimes had the DPS stop to help with the final add especially if it\'s spawned just as the main\'s died but it\'s really not neccesary.\n\nSorry if this has gone on a bit, hope it\'s useful to someone.\n\n*edit*: Possibly worth noting that I use the Mark of Conquest when running this as it helps with the old mana regen.',239962,0,'0',0);

So, I decided to go to dictionary.com and look up the meaning for "Morass". I found one of the definitions to be very ironic to my experiances.\n\n"Something that hinders, engulfs, or overwhelms"\n\nThe overwhelming part is exactly how I felt for a while...until one group finally pulled of and completed the dang thing...\n</rantoff>\n\nAnyways, here are some small tips that make some parts of the encounter loads easier.\n\n*The Rift Keepers that do Shadowbolt Volley are possibly harder to deal with than the second boss. The volley does up to 2k damage to everyone in the group, unless you have some Shadow Resist gear on. If the healers stay in range, they will get hit too. So stay a good number of yards away from the group, probably closer to the person dealing with adds, and run in and heal the tank (or anyone else who is below 50%). My succesful group used this tactic and owned all the volley adds. I was an affliction lock, and just used Siphon life/Drain life most of those encounters, so the healer didn\'t bother healing me, saving tons of mana.\n*Make SURE the tank is the first person to reach the island. The elite will auto engage anyone else who reaches the island before the tank. \n*Remember for the Pyroblast Rift Keepers, if you are meele DPS or have a meele pet out, to move them out of range as soon as they start casting Pyroblast. \n*Use your beacons on waves 13-17. It doesn\'t really matter if you use the beacon on the adds or elite. Our group used the beacon on the elites, and burned them down in less than 30 seconds usually, giving us plenty of killing off extra adds and eating/drinking time.\n*Never, ever ever ever ever use a beacon on a boss. They automatically dispell it, and you are just hurting your group by using it on one, or saving yours for Aeonus.\n\nSome class tips:\n*Mages, you WILL be asked to be on add duty. Don\'t reject a group because they ask you to do adds. You are the best at it. I\'d probably say frost spec is the best for adds, though my group had an arcane/fire mage (Southpark :-D), with a 10k mana pool, so he did fine.\n*Feral druids are THE best tanks. They can hold aggro well, and have a huge DPS output, burning down elites faster. If your choice is a slightly undergeared feral druid or a normal geared prot war, get the druid.\n*Shamans, for the volley Rift Keepers, put down a tremor totem by any meele DPS if there happens to be some. \n\nAnd before you start, remember to clear LOTS of trash. If you have a warlock, kill as much as possible so he/she can get more soul shards from drain soul. \n\nKeep some of these tips in mind, they helped me loads.',159583,0,'0',0);

Mage/ Hunter/warlock. But ofc every kind of setup will work. 10man can even be done as Class run/ same as VOA 10man. \n\n25man\n3 Tanks\n5-7 Healers\n16-17 DPS/ 5-6 AOE is very preferred here. Because you need to waste those Whelps down very fast. Have atleast 3 Range helping downing the Warden, as the other go back to Onyxia when the Whelp grp are dead. \n\n[b]Recommendation[i][/i][/b] DPS atleast 3.5. But nowdays witht the gear avaible ppl are reaching 4.5 and above. \n\nPhase 1: same o \' same o \'\n\nBOSS Health- 4.88M 10man // 22.3M 25man\nOnyxian Warden 189k 10man // 630k 25man\nWhelps 63k 10man // 1890k 25man\n\n**Phase 1 is identical to the original fight. It lasts from 100% health to 65%, and  Onyxia utilizing basic dragon abilities - Flame Breath (heavy hit in frontal cone), Cleave (hitting up to 10 targets), Tail Sweep (with a large knockback), and Wing Buffet (frontal cone knockback).\n\n*Tank Onyxia with your back towards a wall, to avoid knockback from Wing Buffet. \n\n*DPS and Healers should be position at Onyxia\'s sides to avoid both Tail Sweep and the frontal baddies. The tank might need some heavy heals, as the spells hit rather hard, and some cannot be resisted/mitigated. Other than that, you should be fine here.\n\n**Phase 2: There is Something new here\nThis is probably the hardest and the most annoying part of the fight. There are two  things to watch out for - adds and Onyxia\'s new spells. Note to melee DPS - you can still attack Onyxia even while she is in the air, as long as you stand underneath here and follow here when she moves, but remember also to avoid the Breeath if u are a bit outside. \n\n*There are two kinds of adds spawning during this phase - Onyxian Whelps and Onyxian Lair Guards. \n\nThe whelps will spawn in packs of 40 (20 on each side ). The first pack will spawn seconds after Onyxia lifts off in the air, and a pack will hatch every ~90 seconds after that while in this phase. While it is good to have a tank on them, try to AoE them down as soon as possible, as you want to mitigate overall damage and keep your mobility - you\'ll need both.\n\n*Make the offtank the one who Gather his own side of trash and try to move to the other side where the main tank gather his own , when all gathered, Start AOE. This will make it easier on the raid. \n\nThe Lair Guards are new NPCs added in the 3.2.2 version of Onyxia. The guards will spawn more frequently than the whelps (approximately every 30 seconds), and will spawn in pairs (possible a pair from each side). They don\'t have too much health, but have really high melee damage output through abilities like Cleave, Fire Nova, Flame Lash (which reduces fire resistance), and Ignite Weapon (17.5k/25k extra fire damage to targets in melee range). \n\n*It is good to have a tank on them and 1 RANGE DPS to help take them down very fast, while other have their own duty of the fight, but it is better to kill them from afar. Keep your melee DPS away from them at all times.\n\n*The other thing to watch out for are Onyxia\'s spells. Her Fireballs are something you should just heal through - although it is advised that you spread out, as the missiles do damage in a 10 yards wide area. /range on DBM is your friend again. And, of course, there is the Deep Breath...\n\nDeep Breath is now on 100% random cast intervals - which means that DBM, or BigWigs, or whatever boss mods addon you use won\'t be able to warn you in advance. You will however see a raid warning/emote "Onyxia takes a deep breath". As soon as you see that, you need to forget about anything else you are doing, locate Onyxia, figure out which way she is facing, and get behind her quickly. Deep Breath is very unforgiving.\n\n**REMEMBER DO not Tank the Whelps or the Warden in the middle, as she make her Deep Breath all straight. Everyone in the Raid, EVERYONE should have a look where she is aiming her head before she hit the Breath. \n\nPhase 3: NUKE, Yes Nuke it.\n\n**Phase 3 starts when Onyxia\'s health reaches 40%. At this point she will land permanently and cast a raid-wide fear, accompanied by lava eruptions. Raid wide damage, with extras for the tank - nothing you haven\'t seen before. \n\nUnlike the original version of the fight, Onyxia will no longer wipe aggro between phases, which means that your tank from Phase 1 should be the first person she goes to in Phase 3. So as i said, NUKE IT..!\n\nThroughout this phase Onyxia will continue to use all of her abilities from phase 1 (Flame Breath, Cleave, Tail Sweep, Wing Buffet), alongside with Bellowing Roar (3-second fear) and Eruption (AoE during the fear). Whelps will continue to spawn as well, but they won\'t be nearly as many as in Phase 2, so a few of your ranged DPS should be able to handle them quickly.\n\nNote: If a player gets close to the eggs, at any point of the fight, the nearest whelps will hatch. This is why it\'s very important to move carefully and not get knocked back during any of the phases.\n\nVideo Fight ------ > http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZA3CQRj5o&amp;feature=related http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZA3CQRj5o&amp;feature=related ',849238,0,'0',0);

Now, in honor of the World of Warcraft 5-year anniversary, the dreaded brood mother Onyxia is being revamped to make a return to the forefront of Azeroth, as part of our big plans for the upcoming 3.2.2 content patch.\n\nThis permanent update to Onyxia will convert the dungeon into 10- and 25-player modes. We will be adding new items to Onyxias loot table that have the same model as some of the classic loot from this dungeon, like Tier 2 helms, with stats updated to match the current level of content. There will be a special new item too: a normal drake-sized 310% speed flying mount modeled after Onyxia herself called an Onyxia Broodling. We will also be updating the encounter mechanics to be more fitting for modern raiding, but we can guarantee players will get to experience the frightening horror of deep breaths once again.\n\nThen for a limited time, after the 5-year anniversary event officially begins in November, anybody who logs in will receive an Onyxia Brood Whelpling pet.\n\nWere very excited to bring this classic encounter back to provide a fun new experience for both new and veteran players.

I did this as a 526 fury warrior, so a good gear is recommended. Warriors can solo Onyxia even in 25 man mode.\n\n[b]Requirements[/b]\n?spell=29838">(Spell #29838)  as a fury or arms warrior is a must have, if you want to survive, this is also likely true for protection warriors.  our other healing options is ok, but due to the cooldown, second wind is our best option.\n\nAs explained earlier, if you\'re not raider geared, this fight can prove very difficult as an arms for fury warrior. If Onyxia is killing you faster than you can heal with second wind, then try protection warrior specialization. The fight will certainly be agonizingly slow, but at least it\'s still possible.\n\nWhile a shield isn\'t required It\'s a wonderful thing to have in order to use shield wall, and by the time patch 5.4 arrives you will no longer need a shield in order to use ?spell=871">(Spell #871) . As a protection warrior a shield is a must of course, but it\'s mostly optional as a fury or arms warrior.\n\n?spell=46924">(Spell #46924)  is a powerful aoe tool and is one of our key burst that allows us to quickly dps adds and onyxia at the same time. It\'s also a key burst for the second phase of the battle.\n\nRemember, this is all assuming your warrior is at level 90.\n\n[b]Phase 1[/b]\n\nPhase one couldn\'t be more simple. first of all, set Onyxia to focus, then attack and quickly burn down Onyxia as fast as you can. You\'re not on a time limit, but if you want the achievement ?achievement=4402">(Achievement #4402) , you\'ll need to take her down in less than 5 minutes. Same is true for 25 player mode.\n\nThere are a nest of eggs on each side of the room, Onyxia will occasionly use ?spell=18500">(Spell #18500)  to send you flying backwards a few feet. So be sure to position yourself at a location where she doesn\'t knock you into one of her nest.\n\nIf for some reason your second wind isn\'t generating enough health for you to survive, jump into ?spell=71">(Spell #71)  to help lower the damage and hopefully buy you enough time for second wind to catch up. If that isn\'t enough then apply Shield wall or ?spell=118038">(Spell #118038)  to help further lower Onyxia\'s damage output (Die by the sword isn\'t available to protection warriors).\n\n[b]Phase 2[/b]\n\nThis is without a doubt a warrior\'s most dreaded part of the fight. At 65% health Onyxia will get tired of ground combat and take to the air. A bunch of little whelpings and the occasional big dragonkin will swarm you from all directions.\n\nYou can\'t attack onyxia directly with your melee attacks, BUT you can still hit her with area of effect attacks! Keep tracking her on your radar (thanks to your set focus you can just stand under tracker without actually looking for onyxia in the air.) And use all your aoe to your advantage. Bladestorm, ?spell=1680">(Spell #1680) , and ?spell=38537">(Spell #38537)  while you stand under onxyia and you will be sure to hit her as well as any other enemy in the area.\n\nHer Fire Breath is nothing to get excited or worried about, but if you want ?achievement=4404">(Achievement #4404) , you will avoid it. the charge up time for this attack is long, and she always charges forward with this attack, so simply move to one of the sides.\n\nIf you run low on rage, use one of your shouts, auto attack and ?spell=100">(Spell #100)  at adds to build rage (charge and auto attacks won\'t work on Onyxia)\n\n[b]Phase 3[/b]\n\nAt 40% health Onyxia will get frustrated and land once again to engage you in melee combat. If there are still adds around, work them out quickly or the damage can potentially get out of hand.\n\nOnyxia will no longer knock you around, but now she will use ?spell=18431">(Spell #18431)  to fear you for 3 seconds so save your ?spell=18499">(Spell #18499)  for that moment to break and make yourself immune to fear.

Here is how you do eet:\n\n1 Tank, 2 Healers, 7 Ranged.\n\nAssign roles to two runners.  They will jump over the left and ride sides of the cliff where the tunnel ends in her lair.  They do this precisly when she jumps into the air, normally around 65% but in this setup about 50% so just watch for her jump.  After she flies up in the air the runners jump down into their respective tunnels and pop 25 eggs each just by running through them.  Runners take care to do no actual damage to whelps or they pick up aggro.  Remember - for "Many Whelps" achieve you need to pop 50 eggs total within 10 seconds of her liftoff.  These are in addition to the 20 or so eggs that already pop by themselves in each tunnel.  \n\nTank her in the middle of the room, not at a wall.  Ranged is stacked on a marked player they will stack on for the entire fight.  The advantage of this tankspot is when she drops aggro at 65%: in the normal spot on the far wall, at this point within a few strides she is out of raid\'s range.  But having the raid already in the middle means they can pretty much stay in place, doing about 100k to 200k more damage on her so when she flies up she is really at around 50% or less. The other advantages of fighting in the middle is (a) she won\'t land a mile away from you (b) if she does pull a fear off nobody will be feared into the tunnels to pop more eggs.  Of course with no melee needing to stack at her sides, ranged can group up anywhere where they pick up her hit box, anywhere not directly in front of her that is.  \n\nThe second she flies up RL spams GOGOGO and pop heroism.  Everybody stacks on the marked ranged so when whelps come out the tank can aoe and pick up as many as possible.  Trust me, by the time the whelps come out she will be flying down without casting a single fire wall (a cone-attack which normally ranged avoids by standing directly underneath her).  Also, it happens so quick that it\'s likely no big adds have spawned.  \n\nAs soon as she drops tank slaps a taunt on her then pops their major damage mitigation cd and concentrates on staying alive lest the 90 to 100 whelps and bigazz dragon bring him from full health to dead in a blink of an eye.  Tank doesn\'t worry about dpsing Ony too much, just keeping aggro on everything possible and stagger-stepping/overlapping their dam-mit cd\'s.  Ranged will nuke her down extremely quick, usually before a single fear goes off, and most of the whelps dissapear when she dies.  Seems like the fight only took a couple minutes on 10m, and considering its the same number of eggs needing to be popped for both raids, the 25 version of this strat should be much easier.  \n\nIt\'s an mostly easy strat for doing all three achieves at once.  GOOD LUCK.',1683877,0,'0',0);

I would imagine the event was scripted this way so the encounter has a way to reset if the party wipes. Remember, if you were at-level running this with a party would you run out into the middle of the courtyard and start randomly engaging multiple abominations? Hell no, you would hang out near the hallway leading into the courtyard and use it as a safe pull/rest spot. At least I hope you would. ;)\n\nHence, the only way you should encounter this is if you run out there and kill without keeping an eye on the abominations that head towards where it is assumed your party would be. After the initial pull they will slowly come one by one in a certain order towards that gate, make sure you aggro them before they reach it and no bug! Also note-If you drop aggro at any point on an abomination that was near the gate using feign death, vanish, etc. make sure you pick up aggro before it reaches the gate since it will just continue on its merry way after you drop aggro and still possibly bug the event.\n\nHope that helps.

So this is faster.\nMagistrate Barthilas is also easy. So just kill.\nGo into the butchery. Start pulling abonomations. Beware not to get 2 at a time.

And takes some time to kill without propper aoe.\nRamstein the Gorger is by far the hardest boss in the instance. Use every trick you got. Use Wail of the Banshee if you got that from Baroness Anastari. Remember to pull him back to gate, so you have more time to eat/drink after.\nWhen he is death, many skeleton will spawn.

Undead and necromancers control the city while gargoyles and frost wyrms patrol the sky.

KelThuzads rule here is absolute, and from here he stretches his skeletal hands to control the surrounding plaguelands. \n\nThe largest city after Lordaeron\'s capital, Stratholme was destroyed by Arthas in the opening hours of the Third War, as he massacred the city\'s citizenry after they were infected by the Plague of Undeath.

Mostly have a mixture of greens and blues with a purple Skullflame shield.\n\nFor the areas where the gates come down, any AoE is of course, your best friend.  Constantly used Thunder Clap and Cleave throughout the entire instance.  I had no problem progressing and killing everything bit by bit from the living side first, then the undead side, just that it took awhile (3-4 hours I think).  \n\nFor whatever reason, the skull in yellow before the cathedral on the living side seemed to never spawn a boss.  Perhaps it got killed with ghouls and skeles in the mass of mobs around that area and I didn\'t notice but indeed, I couldn\'t tell anything unique about that mob from others if there is any.  \n\nFor the undead side, I had no problems opening the gates from killing the bosses of each ziggerut and the few casters inside the towers.  You\'ll know as each shouts that a crystal has been destroyed.  For Timmy, I simply popped all cooldowns and kept up bloodrush and any other skill I could use as soon as I had rage to use it.  It wasn\'t teribly hard to drop him but it seems that the longer the battle went, the harder he hit (250-300+ a hit on full plate).  \n\nConcerning the glitch in the abomination room past the portculli, I don\'t know if it still exists but now that I recall, I did run in closer to the walls first and killed the abominations furthest from any others so I\'d prevent linking.  I didn\'t happen to see any that moved to the gate; they all seemed to roam in circular patterns around the square (maybe I didn\'t give it enough time).  Either way I had no problem killing them all and fought the good fight the first time but couldn\'t down Ramstein.  Second go I had a dire lack of instant slams and he seemed to pound me even easier.  Third time though I had a good amount of slams, along with firing every cooldown I had and that was just enough to defeat him.  Retaliation, Heroic Throw, Slam when necessary, Blood Rush as often as I could; basically for me at least, I had to go all out and DPS as fast as I could - a little challenging but not impossible.  From there thankfully I had enough health to AoE the skeleton masses down just fine and the guards after were barely stronger than the regular ghouls so they went down fine.  \n\nFrom there in, the rest of the dungeon was not too hard.  A chest in the magistrate\'s room gave 6+ gold, had some lore books in it and also had the painting for the quest from the chapel near the undead side entrance.\n\nDidn\'t die too often but if I did it\'d be attributed nearly 100% of the time to simply pulling too many mobs (20+).  Usually I just fought them in the packs they came in (6-8 at a time) and it went fine with the ocassional food or potion.  Filled my bags easily and due to picking up a purple enchanting scroll, a few orbs, and lots of green and blue NPCable items, probably made out with 100-200 gold not counting what sells on AH.  Good money if you just have time to run the place in full.  \n\nAlso killed the postmen.  The packages and the mobs themselves gave me a toy, a mayor proclimation of some sort (unreadable), and some other parchment that seemed to be junk.

Bring a lot of food and bandages, and be prepared for some tough AoE pulls. As there are so many different specs and gear qualities for warriors, there is no one strategy that works for all of them, so I won\'t try to sum it up as such. Below is merely a list of the major things you need to watch out for, and how I countered it:\n\nThe Cadaver disease reduces health regen by 100% and does mild nature damage every ten seconds. This makes food useless. \nYou can still bandage in between ticks, so don\'t panic. Just avoid all AoE pulls with Cadavers, and if you accidentally get some, kill them first. There are no Cadavers in the Gauntlet, so this is strictly for the two groups before it (side door), or the hellish stealth run through the streets (main door).\n\nIf your choice is between fighting the disease ridden ghouls on the walls, or fighting crypt fiends in the open, fight the ghouls. If a gargoyle comes by when you\'re webbed to the ground, it can get really ugly, really fast. The ghoul disease isn\'t really that bad anyways, as you shouldn\'t be trying to outrun anything anyways.\n\nWalls are your friend. Never go into the streets unless you\'re going straight across to another wall.\n\nThe casters are squishy, and their skeleton adds are squishier. At 70, these are your easiest pulls to get through.\n\nNever, ever die in Slaughter Square. Take them one at a time, unless you are at full health. They hit really, really hard for their level. The best way to avoid bugs and glitches, as there are MANY, is to wait by the door. If you don\'t, you risk having the ones that walk through the door unchallenged respawning on top of you, and that spells death.\n\nTake on Ramstein as close as you can to full health. He doesn\'t hit overly hard, but there are a lot of mobs that come at you after he dies.\n\nThe Baron is a cakewalk if you pop all cooldowns as soon as the fight starts. SS or Cleave, WW or Bladestorm-Any AoE you have will do nicely against the skeletons, and a nigh constant Victory Rush chain will help as well. His Unholy Aura is negligible if you burn fast enough.\n\nWith patience and careful foresight, you can solo UD Strat. Good luck!\n\nEdit: As a side note, if you don\'t have the key or feel like killing Barthilas, he\'s really quite easy. He hits fairly hard, but he doesn\'t have a ton of health, and his knockback isn\'t too bad if you have nothing behind you. He\'ll be found by the church if you\'re running in the front door for the key, or in the corner by Slaughter Square if you came through the side door.',420915,0,'0',0);

Though I didn\'t make it to the baron in under 45 minutes because NO WHERE online tells you how to open the f-ing gate to him.  : )\n\n(For those that wanna know, when you kill all the three bosses who have a door open behind them, go IN the door and kill the five dudes inside.  Do that to all three Zigs on the UD side and the gate opens.  Inside there, kill all the A-bombs and their "leader"/boss comes out.  Kill him and a mass of weak undead come out.  Kill THEM and then some elites will posture about who dares to oppose the baron and they will come out, which, consequently, also finally opens the door to the Baron himself.  At this point, you know what to do.  :D)\n\nThis after a partial Dire Maul run for some friends that are in the 50s/60s for the first time ever.

Sometime when you can get a few friends at 60-80 (even 5 80s would be fun), just come in, walk around, and bask in the instance.  You\'re in a TOWN (complete with signs on the shops and mailboxes..which unfortunately don\'t actually let you mail stuff...) which is a battleground between zelots, being secretly lead by a demon, and hoards of undead.  It\'s dingy, creepy, beat to heck (the sky looks AMAZING though, don\'t forget to look up at least once) filled with traps (the gates), knowledge (books in the Scarlet hold) and intrigues.  You can also pick up some pieces of your Dungeon Set 1 (I got 2 pieces of mine.  Unfortunately, I only got one piece of the one I WANTED, the Priest set for my 48 priest I\'m leveling...)

Thankfully, at this level, it\'s possible to ignore a large portion of the earlier enemies, due to the low aggro radius, and there is a huge shortcut you can take almost at the beginning. It\'s easy to be put off this Dungeon at first as the multi-leveled and twisting turning layout of it can be confusing, but stick with it and it starts to make sense.\n\nFrom the start, run into the hall, ignoring the mobs on each side, and head up the stairs to the right. Go through the door, to a dead end with a small drop into the next room. Drop down here, down the ramps to the left, and through the door to the left, ignoring mobs. You will probably have to clear one Scarshield Legionnaire and a Spellbinder but that\'s it. As you pass through this corridor, you will enter a large relatively open hall with pillars, ravines, bridges and so on, called Hordemar City. Immediately when you enter here, turn right, and look down, to see a burning river of magma. At the extreme right of this, against the wall, is a ledge, that is an easy jump, then another, lower ledge, which will in turn lead you right down to the Firebrand area with all their little tents and stuff. You\'ll lose about 25% HP with each jump - just sit down to recover for a minute each time.\n\nWhen you get down to the Firebrand area, there will be up to two patrols of 2 mobs, which are an easy clear, then you have to clear a side of the corridor to travel down. (While you are here, if you are a Blacksmith, remember to check the Human Remains near the magma river.) The key to success here, as most plate wearers should know anyway, is to absolutely gank the caster classes ASAP - you will be dealing with Invokers (Fire Damage) and Darkweavers (Shadow Damage). Get them dead while the Grunts hammer uselessly at your miles of plate, and then put them down.\n\nAfter this corridor, you have the relatively easy Skitterweb Tunnels - I would just suggest killing the small spiders before the large, because if you do it the other way around, you WILL get overwhelmed. I scraped through one very rough fight with maybe 16 fresh adds before I figured this out. At 65, you should be able to go right round the back of Mother Smolderweb without her aggroing - you really don\'t want to do the rest of the Dungeon with her annoying Mothers Milk poison effect on you, although it can be cured or prevented easily enough. But if you are trying for the Mothers Milk Quest, then you want to be able to come back to her to intentionally get poisoned last thing before you HS out.\n\nClimbing up out of the Tunnels, you can kill about 1 - 3 ogres, then hop up and past the rest to your left. You may or may not be able to sneak past the Scorpids in the next corridor, they are easy kills, but twice I have had Bloodaxe Raiders and Worgs add when fighting them. Just be careful.\n\nUp the next ramp, go right, and you can, if you need to, go kill Halcyon and catch a Worg Pup, by going to the end of the corridor (ignore everything to your left, a worthless boss and dead end basically), or you can just go up the next ramp to your right, into Blackhand Hall. You should be able to skip through here with no fights, until you get across the wooden planks at the end, where you will be forced to clear a couple of Veterans (nasty kicks and stuns) and Summoners/ Invokers. As usual, Casters must die first, no matter what.\n\nAfter here, you\'ll enter the final area, and there will be about 5 - 7 mobs you must clear to progress. They will hold a sample of all the different enemies from the Spire - trolls, orcs and ogres. Shouldn\'t give you too much hassle really, as long as you prioritise your targets effectively and heal up between fights.\n\nFinally, it\'s Overlord Wyrmthalak, and this guy gave me a SERIOUS fight and fright. It went right to the nail, and I think I got lucky with the adds, because when he called his two helpers (two random orcs), they seemed to take forever to arrive. I took him from 17k to 3k before they actually got involved, and then it was a case of putting him down and turning on them. Even still, it was damn close - I had potioned up, activated Last Stand, Shield Wall, and my Talisman of Arathor, and it had all dropped again and I still had both of them to kill. What saved me was a very very timely Intimidating Shout - both adds ran off for 5 seconds, and I managed to quickly bandage from about 150HP up to 1800 before they got back. Shield Block and Revenge, and they died. One thing I\'ll say about OW though, is watch that knockback - it\'s as much a knockUP as it is back. I knew it was coming, but I expected to go back at a shallow angle. What he actually does it punt you way up in the air, and the fall damage is brutal. Get yourself stuck under a rock or overhang or something for this fight, and save yourself some pain.\n\nAchievement won, Letter found, missions either complete or partially complete, and once you\'ve come this far, almost anything earlier in the Dungeon is a breeze, and can be done at a leisurely pace. I went through it backwards to kill the other bosses, only missing out on summoning Urok - just can\'t manage 10 elites in a row, half of them casters, without a party :(\n\nAnyway, I\'ve rambled on long enough, but I genuinely enjoyed this Dungeon, as it was challenging, but not to the point of stupidity, and to manage it yourself like that is very satisfying. Plus, it would seem these days, there is little choice - I had spent a fortnight LFG for LBRS and it\'s the same old story - who does classic stuff any more these days? Nobody.\n\nGo rock the \'Spire people :)',646983,0,'0',0);

No one else was interested, so the paladin tank and I (SV Hunter) decided to see how far we could get before we "hit a wall" if you know what I mean, not expecting much. We both started the night at 59, and finished it at 60. I was in a mix of quest blues and greens except for my Hurricane (average iLevel in the high 40s/low50s) and brought along my runed demon dog, and I think she had some PvP epics (at least her shield).  We only wiped twice and ended up two-manning the whole instance. Mobs conned a mixture of green and yellow elite to us. It seemed deceptively easy.\n\nShe seemed like she knew the dungeon, though, so maybe she was an old school player from the early days as I am, so maybe knowing the dungeon like the back of your hand had a little to do with it. I\'m not trying to brag here... I\'m just completely stunned that we were able to do that and kinda sad that this dungeon has been nerfed HARD.  Even with the conflagration at the end, my pet could handle the boss while I FD to lose aggro until the tank regained her senses. I remember back in the day when you had to have 10 people and a hunter needed to pull one of the adds over the bridge toward the Beast\'s room in order for the group to not wipe.\n\nAnyway, UBRS is not the player killer it used to be by far.  As long as you stay away from the whelps and keep your back against the wall, a level appropriate 5man should be able to handle it with little issue.  I daresay we found it easier than LBRS since my full LBRS group had a few deaths here and there.\n\nAs an aside, the Worg Pup an Smolderweb Hatchling aren\'t avail anymore. :(',1296361,0,'0',0);

LBRS is not harder than any regular 5 man at the moment. For UBRS I\'d recommend to get 8-10 people. Theoretically UBRS is doable with regular 5 man group, although you need someone who is able to offtank on Drakissath and healer, who knows what is he doing and doing it well. First of all, most hard thing - to get a group. When you summoned everyone, I\'d recommend to go kill http://DBURLHERE/?npc=9046 Scarshield Quartermaster  as a group and take BWL prequest from letter (it is experience, and at least you will save some time to guys who getting BWL groups in future...).\nUBRS itself is demanding very accurate pulls. Even if you got full group, 2 pulled trash packs will most likely give you hard time. Notice, that orc packs in first room and in room after Rookery containing http://DBURLHERE/?npc=9819#abilities Blackhand Veteran  with very nasty knockbacks, so you have to tank them properly, otherwise you risking to be knocked to other packs (or back from edge of floor to rookery eggs in 2nd case).

On Drakissath you will have to have 2 tanks, also, remember that he hits hard even now, dps will be killed in 2-3 swings, so your healer will have to put efforts in healing. You will have about 20 second to kill adds before 1st Conflagrarion, after that your tanks will have to hold Drakissath on them.',839049,0,'0',0);

It is located in Ironforges lowest depths. The area is a true marvel of organic stone formation: No dwarf has touched this area with pick or chisel. Ironforges kings are buried in the Hall of Thanes, and the old throne is here as well. Also within this cavernous area is the ancient, weathered Iron Forge  perhaps the greatest titan artifact ever unearthed. The dwarves do not use this holy anvil, but keep it near their honored dead and the seat of their power.LOC 76,77 \n\nThe area contains: \n\nThe Hall of Thanes, where the past Kings of Ironforge are buried.(Note that the RPG implies that Hall of Thanes is the name of Old Ironforge rather than just being a location within Old Ironforge.) \n\nThe Old Throne \n\nThe object for which Ironforge is named, the Iron Forge, an ancient Titan artifact. \n\nOld Ironforge exists in game, but it is not accessible through normal means, and as a closed area, contains no NPCs, items, or other such content. In the High Seat area of Ironforge, there is a hidden door behind Deliana. This hidden door leads to a long hallway descending to the underground chamber of Old Ironforge. Old Ironforge consists of a large column of stone in a pool of lava. At the top is a carpeted platform, and a path winds down around the column to two closed doors. The ceiling features large purple crystal formations. \n\nThere are several ways of getting into Old Ironforge that were known to work in the past. Blizzard periodically implements workarounds to prevent access to closed zones, so now some of them may have been fixed. \n\nThe first is to start a duel with a mage behind the pole outside of the bank in Ironforge. QUICKLY run into the back of the king\'s room (it is close enough to where the original duel started, so the duel will not cancel). Run up next to the door and have the mage sheep you. If all goes well, you will wander under the door and the sheep will break. If not, try it again. \n\nThis is an alternative to the first way.  You\'ll also need a mage friend. Starting facing the bank in Ironforge, take the passageway to the right so it goes to the Great Forge. Find the second corner on your left after you exit the passageway. The corner should look like a direct right angle on the map. To make sure you have the right corner, look on the map and imagine it as an arrow. The arrow should be facing north-west. If your there, jump and press forward against it. Eventually you\'ll get the hang of it and keep jumping up until your head reaches the ceiling, or a tad bit close to it. The mage must get there too. Then start a duel with a mage, and run up next to the door and have the mage sheep you. Repeat until you wander under the door and the sheep breaks on the other side. \n\nAlternatively, if you\'re a mage or a priest, go to the farm in the hills above the Wetland\'s Farm via the Ironforge Airstrip. Be sure to bring some Light Feathers with you. Find the tunnel that goes nowhere (drops off to nothingness). Face the great forge in Ironforge and use a speed booster (epic mount and sprint were confirmed to work) after using a slow fall spell (mage Slow Fall or priest Levitate) and jump in that direction. After approximately 30 seconds, you will find yourself swimming. Swim up, and have the camera above you at all times so you can see where the top is. The next step is to swim into the tunnel that goes to Old Ironforge, but it takes time and a few tries to figure out how to get into that. Note that, as of the patch 2.0.3, you can no longer do this with Noggenfogger because Noggenfogger\'s slow fall duration was lowered to 15 seconds. Also note that you can not use a combination of the Noggenfogger Elixir and the Cape of Slowfall in this method, you do not have a long enough period of slowfall time to make',150021,0,'0',0);

Once the royal crypts of Lordaeron\'s glorious Capital City, it is a grotesque pit of aborrations of every kind where horrifying mutant Abominations live among the walking corpses of the Undead. And despite this, it is the closest thing to home the Forsaken have.\n\nThe downfall of Lordaeron had its turning point played out in the palace still accessible in the middle of the old city\'s ruins. Here, Prince Arthas cut down King Terenas Menethil, his own father, in an ultimate act of betrayal. Arthas went on to ravage his father\'s kingdom at the head of the undead Scourge. His war raged on into the elven lands of Quel\'Thalas, where he rent the soul of the ranger Sylvanas Windrunner from her and made her a banshee. The Plague of Undeath claimed more and more victims, and soon, all of Lordaeron was covered in the dark plague.\n\nEvents took another turn in the ruins of the Capital City. "King" Arthas found his powers weakened, and his Dreadlord lieutenants turned on him, forcing him to flee the capital. As a result of his weakness, the banshee Sylvanas was freed from service to the Scourge, as were many other undead minions. As the Forsaken formed, Sylvanas began to plan the assassination of Arthas. When this failed, she moved to strike up an alliance with Grand Marshal Garithos to support her in a power struggle against the Dreadlords. Sylvanas promised the humans that their city would be theirs again with the defeat of the Dreadlords, and they reluctantly gave their support to the Forsaken. Garithos ended up betrayed and cannibalized, his promised city turned into the fortress of the undead.\n\nThe undead, needless to say, dominate the Undercity.

At 40 and 41 I was just farming http://DBURLHERE/?npc=6910 Revelosh  hoping to get a nice mail bracer. Killed him 8 times, never saw any bracer at all - 6x plate tanking boots of Bear/Boar/Stamina/Defense and 1x each of gloves and shoulders. Took about 15 mins per run and I got about 4 bars of xp each run.\n\nGot bored of seeing plate boots, and when I dinged 42 I decided to try the back entrance. Managed to kill http://DBURLHERE/?npc=7291 Galgann Firehammer , http://DBURLHERE/?npc=4854 Grimlok  (dropped the polearm!), and http://DBURLHERE/?npc=2748 Archaedas . Took a couple of hours and a couple of deaths and got me most of a level worths of xp.\n\nTips:\n\n- Get a pet with an aoe ability so that Mend Pet doesn\'t pull mobs to you. I like bears (Swipe).\n\n- Pull mobs well back. Lots of mobs in here will run at low health, and while a full party can (usually) handle two packs at once, your pet can\'t.\n\n- Kill casters first.\n\n- If your pet is taking too much damage from packs of 3+ mobs then drop a trap and pull one of them to you with Distracting Shot or Multi-Shot. You can even tank one for a bit yourself (although don\'t try that with frenzied troggs).\n\n- An alternative slower method of dealing with large packs is to burn 1 or 2 down quickly then feign death when your pet dies. This works well on Grimlok and the pulls in the temple with a statue and 5+ non-elite adds.\n\n- Grimlok - kill the basilik first and the geomancer second.\n\n- Archaedas has 22k hp but is pretty easy if you pull him all the way up to the big room above. Put on cheetah and start running as soon as you activate him, you don\'t need to do any damage because he\'s not leashed. Then it\'s just tank and spank and you kill the weak (350hp) adds that eventually make their way up, while keeping your pet on the boss. Having your melee weapon skill high enough that you can actually hit them if they get close is very, very useful.\n\n- If, like me, you want this dungeon done for the quest chain that starts in the room behind the last boss and rewards http://DBURLHERE/?item=34421 Cave Crawler\'s Mail Treads , be aware that although you can get this quest at 40, you can\'t do the last part of the chain until 45... >.> I might have waited had I realised that, it would be MUCH easier at L45.

I\'ve done this place many times farming small brilliant shards.\n\nRFD is located in the southern barrens, just north of the great lift on the east side of the road. You\'ll see the meeting stone from the road. To get to the instance, just go straight and a little right. You\'ll see an enormous pig head made of branchs or something. Then you have to kill about 6 lvl 35 elite pig looking dudes one at a time to get to it.\n\nThis place has lvl 39-40 elites, mostly in groups of 2-3 elites and 2-3 non elites. They\'re almost all undead so priest can shackle away.\n\nGo to the cathedral in stormwind to pick up the quest Bring the Lite (alliance, sorry no idea for horde). The quest reward is a 1h axe or a melee type necklace. This quest requires lvl 39 to pick up I believe. Once you\'re in the instance there is a guy that starts an escort quest as well. Please let me know if you know of any other quests, horde or alliance.\n\nOnce you\'re in the instance, go right and go past about 4 sets of mobs and you\'ll be in the spiral. As soon as you get into the spiral you\'ll see Glutton. He\'s a big ugly stitches dude. Do your best to pull him back up to the path you were just in and you\'ll be best off. I think he\'s a 39 elite. He drops either a green one handed axe or some sweet blue lvl 37 leather rogue/feral druid shoulders, luckily most of the time he drops the shoulders. Go right and follow the spiral up to Amnennar the Coldbringer.\n\nThere\'s about 3 sets of 2 elite guys that slowly patrol the spiral, be very careful to take them out as they will inevitably chain pull other groups of mobs on you. Additionally, there are about 3 sets of 2 non elite skeletons that run up and down the spiral, same story with them.\nTake care to not go too close to the left side if you\'re lower than lvl 40, as you will aggro pull a guy on the edge above you. They will chain pull and there will be 50 guys on you by the time they run down the spiral to get you.\n\nThe rare spawn guy, Ragglesnout, will be about half way up the spiral by a hut if he\'s there at all. Everyone has different luck, but I\'ve done this instance many many times and only seen him twice. He drops a sweet 2h sword, a blue shield and a mail belt, all lvl 39 or so. I got the belt once and the shield once.\n\nAt the top of the spiral (and after about 15 sets of mobs) is Amnennar the Coldbringer. She is a lvl 41 elite. About twice per fight she will do somethign to blast you back. If you keep your back to the wall there you will not fly far, otherwise she could blast you right off the edge and you\'ll get back in time to see your dead party and a $%^&amp;ed off lich king. After she gets to gets down to about 75% health she summons 3 spirits to come help her fight, then again at 40% she summons 4 more. These guys all despawn when she dies so keep your dps on Ammennar. I\'ve heard tricks about hunters using volley to aggro them all then feigning, just to buy time for them to run back and forth. Whatever you do, don\'t have your party separate and try killing them, you\'re wasting your time and your healer won\'t keep up. Of course, I"m talking about a party of lvl 39\'s, bring your 60 mage to grease them all and forget what I just said. Ammennar seems to mostly drop the mail chest and mail head armor, shammy gear if I recall. Next I\'d say she drops the plate armor and cloth lich chest and the dagger least often. BTW, she drops 2 blues most of the time, sometimes just 1 blue and a green. Kill her to complete Bring the Lite quest.\n\nAFter you kill her, go back down the spiral and where you took a right after killing Glutton, go left and you\'re on your way to Mordresh Fire Eye. Just follow that path until you find a fork in the road. You\'ll pass about 4 more sets of mobs and 3 patrols. The little skellies fall easily with some AoE. Have your warrrior aggro them all, hunter drop an immolation trap and use volley, then mage aoe\'s right along and they\'ll all fall in seconds. Mordesh starts throwing fireballs once most of the little skellies are pulled and it\'s hard to not pull them all at once. The warrior,pally or hunter\'s pet can easily tank him while you take care of the little guys. He drops a blue every time, a cloth belt, caster necklace or an offhand.\n\nNow you can go to the back way to Tuten\'kash. You\'ll end up in a small room with about 4 sets of mobs in it. Once you\'ve cleared it, there\'s a gong in there, ring it once to summon a set of mobs, summon again, same thing, then the third time it summons Tuten\'kash. He drops like 10 different blue gloves that can be good for anyone, some plate armor or a one hand mace.',319133,0,'0',0);

As such, I just wanted to go over a couple of things to make your lives a little easier and relieve some stress.  These are very important points that anyone going into this dungeon should be aware of.  (Please note, none of this information has to do with fighting bosses.)[/small]\n\nIf its your first time entering Gnomeregan, youll receive a quest in the beginning (The G-Team), for which youll be given a parachute.  If you have already completed this quest though, you wont be given a parachute and will have to retrieve it yourself.  Dont worry!  Its not far.  Please be advised:  Everyone should take a parachute to navigate this dungeon effectively!\n\nTo get a [b]parachute[/b], look for a box not far from where you first arrive at the dungeon.  Its out on the ledge overlooking the area you need to jump down.   (Heres a screenshot of it:  http://DBURLHERE/?zone=721/gnomeregan#screenshots:id=253302 http://DBURLHERE/?zone=721/gnomeregan#screenshots:id=253302 )  If your team doesnt approach the box to get parachutes of their own, its not a bad idea to ask and make sure everyone has one.\n\nNext, jump down and try landing on the big gear sticking out of the floor, since youll be safe from any aggro up there.  This is where things get irritating.\n\nAround the time you and your team approach the Vicious Fallout water elemental, you might find yourselves caught unawares and being attacked by what seems to be an [b]army of Caverndeep Ambushers[/b], mobs that spawn frequently in the first part of the instance and which run around together at a fast pace.  They arent elites, and they can be taken downif people work together.  Normally though, this is when people start freaking out at attacking one another, asking who pulled and who aggroed everything.\n\nListen up  its no ones fault.  No one got aggro, and no one pulled them to you.  They spawned and came out of nowhere; thats why they call them Ambushers.  Stop wasting valuable time arguing about whos fault it is, when clearly its no ones, and start working as a team to take them out.  Get some crowd control.  Use some AOEs.  They can be killed, so long as people realize this is a normal occurrence and is meant to take you off guard.  (Hunters:  Be aware!  Ive seen many hunters get blamed, including myself on my Hunter toon, for their pets aggroing this mob.  You can try arguing that your pet isnt to blame, but normally its not worth it.  Just hope that you dont get kicked for something that isnt your fault!)\n\nFinally, in regards to [b]parachutes [/b] once you use yours at the beginning of the dungeon, youll find it is no longer in your inventory.  Once you defeat the Electricutionar 6000 (the crazy green guy in a spider machine), theres another box on the ground with parachutes in it right where you were fighting the boss.  Everyone should loot this box to pick up another parachute so you can jump off the ledge there safely.\n\nIts these simple things that make a world of difference, and I hope that by reading this it may help some people out there.  Play smart, play safe, and work together as a team.',1613508,0,'0',0);

In my farming, I\'ve figured out that I can get to Thermaplugg, kill him and get out of the instance in about 5 minutes.\n\nBasically, what you do is enter the instance, run straight ahead and pick up the parachute from the chest overlooking the drop off.  Jump, then click on the parachute and slowly fall down.  Run out the western door.  I usually run down the left side of the next tunnel which is a little higher than the right side.  I find that if I can stay right on the slightly raised ridge, I can avoid aggro on both the mobs on the left and the mobs on the right.\n\nI run down the ridge to the next big drop off.  Right as you exit the tunnel, there\'s a column in front of you and slightly to the left.  If you run off the ledge there, you\'ll land on a little structure.  From there, turn left and run off the structure onto the lip that runs around the outskirts of the room.  Hop off the lip and duck down into the second exit on the left.  You\'ll know it\'s the correct one because of the Dark Iron Agent sitting right by the door.\n\nI do essentially the same thing in this tunnel as in the first one - run down the left side but on the slightly raised ridge that separates the left from the middle.  About half the time I aggro everything past the little tunnel on the left just so I can kill everything at the same time that I kill Thermaplugg - other times, I skip try to avoid aggro.  It doesn\'t seem to matter much - I almost always aggro something on the way back up the tunnel anyway.\n\nAfter Thermaplugg\'s dead, head back up the tunnel and take the workshop tunnel (which is now on your right).  Run through the workshop and hop on the elevator.  If you\'ve managed to acquire aggro, jumping on the elevator will fix it.  Ride up to the top, run down the hallway and open the door.  You can avoid aggroing the first pack past the door, but you\'ll aggro the other packs.  Just run through.

The problem is that Gnomer often doesn\'t HAVE small groups. Once you get deep into the area you\'ll encounter one or two elites paired with maybe four or five regular mobs. \n\nEven at 40, having five or so of these little guys pound on you all at once really adds up and it can be hard to control so many foes. Trying to keep aggro on your pet can be rough since you\'ll need to cast Mend Pet at times and that will usually pull mobs to you. \n\nWhere I died was RIGHT outside the last boss door.

Dubbed the \'Wailing Caverns\', these natural caves were filled with steam fissures which produced long, mournful wails as they vented. Naralex believed he could use the caverns\' underground springs to restore lushness and fertility to the Barrens - but to do so would require siphoning the energies of the fabled Emerald Dream. Once connected to the Dream however, the druid\'s vision somehow became a nightmare. Soon the Wailing Caverns began to change - the waters turned foul and the once-docile creatures inside metamorphosed into vicious, deadly predators. It is said that Naralex himself still resides somewhere inside the heart of the labyrinth, trapped beyond the edges of the Emerald Dream.

The Alliance has established a staging area in the settlement of Valgarde, but their presence seems to have sparked off an unforeseen event: the return of the vrykul.\n\nThese formidable warriors have begun attacking Horde and Alliance settlements, and many of the vrykul are pouring out of the fortress of Utgarde Keep, not far from Valgarde. The vrykul\'s motives and their whereabouts for the past several thousand years remain a mystery. Regardless, there is no doubt that the vrykul\'s sudden resurgence has touched off an ongoing battle for control of the region.\n\nDwarven prospectors, in the meantime, have uncovered mysterious relatives whose skin is etched in strange runes. These iron dwarves may provide the missing link needed for the dwarves to piece together the mystery of their creation.\n\nOn the eastern shore, the Forsaken have arrived, carrying a plague of their own to unleash upon the Lich King. Queen Sylvanas has been methodically and patiently overseeing the formulation of this contagion for several years, and the time has come at last to test its effectiveness against the Scourge.\n\nBefore bringing the battle to the Lich King, both the Horde and Alliance must overcome the immediate threat of the vrykul and answer the questions that the warriors reemergence has posed. Where have the vrykul been? What do they want? Most disturbing of all, what if they aligned with the Lich King?\n\nPerhaps only time will tell.

It could have then broken through the wall of Uldum and infiltrated the Caverns of Time[/i]. \n\n[i]There, it could have slowly corrupted Nozdormu just as presumably an Old God drove Deathwing mad. Hence the creation of the Infinite Dragonflight. [/i]\n\nWe also know that it is possible to kill a Dragon Aspect, as shown in the Eye of Eternity in WotLK.',739446,0,'0',0);

When the first khans were born of their union, it is said that they murdered their father, for shame of their misshapen appearance. They were born filled with rage and savagery and have not calmed in the centuries that followed. The first of their kind, the first khans, gave rise to the five tribes of the centaur. The race swept across Desolace and soon became legendary for its brutality. The diligent night elves held them in check for ages until the Burning Legion rained its destruction upon the world. The night elves left the centaur out of necessity for their own survival during the wars, allowing the twisted race to assume control of Desolace. Though fortunate enough not to be scorched into oblivion in the demon wars, Desolace was savaged nonetheless due to the centaur\'s ceaseless aggression. No longer threatened by night elves, the tribes plagued other plains races - chiefly, the peaceful tauren. This struggle endured for generations, until recently, when the tauren were at last driven from Desolace. The centaur were never content with controlling Desolace and have followed their tribal khans in a series of clashes with other races throughout southern and central Kalimdor. \n\nThe mountainous barriers of the Stonetalons lie to the north and the Thousand Needles to the southeast, isolating Desolace from much of the rest of Kalimdor. The grasslands and mesas of Mulgore stand directly east, and the land runs rugged and open to the storm-tossed coast to the west. The winds create waterspouts against the lowland hills along the shore. The western coastline of Desolace is lush in sad contrast to the wasteland of its interior. Desolace is a gray, rocky wasteland littered with bones. It seems almost under a supernatural curse, its skies always black and stormy, with lightning and high winds a constant throughout the realm. The surrounding mountains form a significant barrier to travel, a key reason why the centaur have never established more than a sporadic presence elsewhere on Kalimdor. Five barbarous centaur tribes dominate the entire region with the strength of overwhelming numbers and unequaled ferocity. Each tribe is led by one of the dreaded khans and is known by a distinctive tribal color - Black, Brown, Green, Red, and Yellow. Members use the color to mark their weapons and their faces. The khans who lead each tribe rarely have contact with each other except in times of war. There were no other cultures of any note in all of Desolace. The centaur had run them all down in their unceasing lust for conquest. The only animals that can sustain themselves in the arid and violent land are beasts such as lions, raptors, sand serpents, and harpies.\n\nIn recent times Horde and Alliance have set up outposts in the desolate land, and only four of the five tribes control Desolace. \n\nDesolace is home to several characters of note. At Ghost Walker Post, Maurin Bonesplitter and Takata Steelblade seek aid in the battle against the Burning Blade. In Shadowprey Village, Taiga Wisemane attempts to cleanse the demonic taint that the Burning Legion has brought with it. And at Nijel\'s Point, Kreldig Ungor sends bold adventurers to the wide corners of the land in search of mystical items and treasure. In addition, Rexxar used to wander these lands with his bear companion Misha until the Dark Portal reopened. \n\nTaken from WoWWiki.com (http://www.wowwiki.com/Desolace http://www.wowwiki.com/Desolace )',239983,0,'0',0);

What\'s more is how littered the area is with mithril, truesilver, iron, and gold.  In swim form, I easily grab the following just swimming from one end (near feralis) down to the spoon part (tanaris entrance):\n\nmithril x10\ntrusilver x1\ngold x1\niron x2\n(in stacks)\n\nThis goes pretty quickly since most mobs are neutral sea turtles or fish; at levels 43+, even the angry mobs can be easily avoided.  I\'ve made my pass through the entire zone at least 10 times, and I\'ve gotten attacked a grand total of...1 time.  If you have the turtle mount, or if you\'re a druid and need those metals, this is a great place to get them; I rarely go more than 20 secs without a node popping up on the map, if I even go that long.  Plus, because ease of movement here is selective to class/profession, you won\'t likely see any other players, which means near all of the nodes belong to you >:3.

Most of the quests can be soloed easily and there are only two group quests, both on the Horde side (http://DBURLHERE/?quest=6641/vorsha-the-lasher http://DBURLHERE/?quest=6641/vorsha-the-lasher  and http://DBURLHERE/?quest=6621/king-of-the-foulweald http://DBURLHERE/?quest=6621/king-of-the-foulweald ). Notable Alliance quest chains include the "Elune\'s Tear" chain, available from Pelturas Whitemoon http://DBURLHERE/?npc=3894">(NPC #3894) , the "Raene\'s Cleansing" chain, available from Raene Wolfrunner (?npc=3691">(NPC #3691) ), and the "Tower of Althalaxx" chain that begins in Darkshore when given to the player by Sentinel Elissa Starbreeze (?npc=3657">(NPC #3657) ).\n\nGathering professions such as skinning and herbalism (but not so much mining, although there are some veins to find) mix well with this zone. Many of the mobs here are skinnable (though perhaps not as many as in Darkshore, due to the large numbers of Furbolgs, Demons and Forsaken Undead) and herbs are almost as bountiful as the beasts. I\'ve found that if you ever forget to do a bit of skinning and need to raise your skill afterwards, you can visit the Howling Vale (West of the road to Felwood and just before the border between the two zones) and grind Terrowulf Worgen mobs. They\'re Lvl 28-30 (with one rare mob named the Terrowulf Packlord (?npc=3792">(NPC #3792) ) who can reach up to Lvl 32 and drops the Wolfpack Medallion and Ruffled Chaplet green items) and are skinnable. The mobs (excluding the Packlord) respawn quickly and a player at a similar level can expect to clear the area just as they begin to respawn again. As a result, you get a constant supply of leather and a bit of added XP. I realise that grinding XP is never great compared to questing, but it\'s good to get a little bonus  since you\'re going to have to collect leather anyway.\n\nFinally, World PVP is an attraction for both factions. Horde players often raid Astranaar (some realms can expect several hour-long raids a day) due to its location between two Orcish towns. Through personal experience, I\'ve discovered that this can range from Lvl 20-30 players that think that they can measure up to the guards to Lvl 80 players on sadistic rampages [b](just like Crossroads raids, amirite?)[/b]. Alliance raids, to be honest, are less common but do occur occasionally on the large Horde town of Splintertree Post.\n\n[u]Tips on Exploring/Questing in Ashenvale:[/u][ul][li]If you\'re on a PvP realm or have your PvP turned on, watch out while you\'re in Astranaar or on the roads directly outside the town.[/li][li]The Boss Level (Lvl ?) Dragons of Nightmare spawn at Bough Shadow, just to the East of the Alliance outpost of Forest Song. One of the four mobs will emerge from a portal on the side of the Great Tree, and elite mobs also patrol the surrounding area. Many players have been killed when trying to complete their zone maps, so beware when entering below Lvl 60.[/li][/ul]Thanks for reading this guide to Ashenvale!\n- Zemrock',1050741,0,'0',0);

There will be a tree in front of you. Turn left and jump toward the sloped surface and you should be able to bypass the rocks and get to another potential mineral node (also an herb node here).

It is said that this avatar was infused with a portion of Sargeras\' soul which he controlled. Medivh was born with this fragment of his soul, and it later escaped back to the Twisting Nether. Brann Bronzebeard is pretty confident that the real Sargeras never actually set foot on Azeroth, implying the real Sargeras is still around in the Twisting Nether.Brann also believes, along with others, that the portion of the spirit that escaped still endures, hungering for revenge.\n\nThe implications of this is that Sargeras now exists as three separate entities, the real Sargeras, the avatar of Sargeras, and the portion of his spirit that was dispersed to the Twisting Nether.\n\nThat Sums it up for you buddy :D',338103,0,'0',0);

Every so often he does a channeled DoT on random party member that can (and should) be interrupted.\n\nAfter a while he will cast "Asphyxiate" and lift the entire party into the air, slowly reducing their health to very low  (possibly 1 HP, I didn\'t check). Following this he will channel an AoE heal (again, forgot the name), that heals [b]the party and himself[/b] for 10% HP per tick. You will want to interrupt this after the first tick to give your healer breathing room. He will also cast a self-heal called something like "Renew Rotten Flesh" that I think heals him to full, either way it should be interrupted pronto.\n\nHe carrys on in this fashion until he reaches around 25-30%, when he will cast "Archangel Form" or something similar, stop meleeing and start to cast a pulsing aoe aura of 5000hp per tick, around once a second. This is just a burn phase, kill him before he kills you. Overall a pretty tough fight, interrupts and proper use of tank CDs are definitely needed.\n\n[b][u]2. Baron Silverlaine:[/u][/b]\nNothing too remarkable here, he periodically summons adds (the named Worgen that used to be bosses in the old SFK). They have various abilities and when you have 2-3 of them on the tank the damage is quite high. We chose to ignore the adds and just burn him down, you\'ll probably need CDs by the end but it\'s not too much trouble.\n\n[b][u]3. Commander Springvale:[/u][/b]\nThe hardest boss by far. Clear out his room then you can enter to pull him properly. He comes with two adds, and during the fight more will periodically spawn from each doorway to reinforce him. The adds are the familiar ghost trash mobs from old SFK (along with the "Forsaken Skills" ability), but here they buff the Commander with "Unholy Might", a damage increase that stacks to 3 and lets the Commander do a special ability.\n\nThe goal here is to kill the adds ASAP and interrupt their cast of Unholy Might. If you have 2 adds + a fully buffed Commander + AoE damage (which I\'ll get to), it becomes hard to stay alive. so, kill adds -> DPS boss -> new adds spawn -> kill adds, repeat until dead.\n\nThe Commander has a few AoE abilities of note. One is "Desecration" which works just like the usual DK\'s version except it does heavy AoE damage if you stand in it. The other is a frontal cone AoE called Shield of Something, I forget. Face him into the wall to avoid it hitting the group. I don\'t know if these were as a result of him getting 3 stacks of Unholy Might or what, the encounter is very chaotic and it\'s hard to tell exactly what\'s going on. We ended up letting multiple casts of Unholy Might go out and we still killed him, it was just a little messy.\n\nOut strat was to have ranged stand on the stage where he spawns, and have the tank pull him down to face the wall at the bottom of the stairs, so the tank was between the ranged and where the adds spawn. When he cast Desecration the tank would turn him round to face the opposite wall.\n\nThere were various other debuffs thrown out by either the mobs or the Commander but they didn\'t seem to do anything noteworthy.\n\n[b][u]4. Alchemist Something?:[/u][/b]\nA forsaken alchemist, yup I forgot the name again. Very easy boss. Hits for barely anything, randomly throws vials at party members. They didn\'t hit for much, I think one left a poison debuff.\n\nAfter a while he will cast "Random Mixture" or something similar. 9/10 times for us this was a poison debuff applied to everyone that did damage and (I think) restricted movement speed. I don\'t remember well because the debuff is removed by moving, so it is rather trivial. On one occasion he cast this and it gave everyone a firey DoT that also gave you 100% crit chance. Healable.\n\nAfter casting the AoE he will start raining Ice Shards down from the sky, watch where they will fall and move away. Simple.\n\n[b][u]5. Lord Godfrey:[/u][/b]\nAlso pretty easy. Periodically summons non-elite adds that are easily AoE\'d down, immediately afterwards will cast "Pistol Barrage" which is a frontal cone AoE that does high damage if you stand in it. Simply move behind him. Ranged can stand on the platform near the door and not have to move at all. Also did a Mortal Strike/Bleed debuff that wasn\'t particularly harmful. \n\n[b][u]6. Trash[/u][/b]\nThe trash pretty easy compared to some heroics, only a little CC was needed and it was more to reduce incoming damage than to avoid particular spells being cast. It\'s mostly Undead so shackle and roots are good. The trash in the hall immediately following the first boss should be pulled up the stairs as they do an AoE fear. Some skeleton warrior mobs have a bone shield that does AoE damage when it breaks. Nothing particularly noteworthy here.',1152839,0,'0',0);

For non-DK\'s out there: you need at least 30k dps with a few good self heals to survive.

I got close a couple times, by killing the adds, mainly the wailing gaurdsmen that heal him. But with so much going on between the shield blast, desecration, and adds, it was just to much for me. Try him if you want, but he is skip-able.\nLord Walden- Another easy fight, assuming you avoid the frost mixtures he casts in the air(obvious where they land) and the other AOE\'s he does. I was able to solo this at 85 dps, to carry my party through after the tank snafu\'ed, so any 90 shouldn\'t have a problem with this guy.\nLord Godfrey- This fight doesn\'t disappoint, got it on the second try. First and most obvious thing, AVOID PISTOL BARRAGE! You\'d be surprised how people under-rate this move\'s lethality. He starts to cast in the direction he\'s firing, so as soon as he starts casting, get outta the way. He summons a few ghouls which don\'t require your attention. The most damage I was taking was from cursed bullets, like 20k...x2...frequently. My first failed attempt I tried to \'bob-and-weave" as much as possible; But the second, successful attempt, I just stayed in one spot, meleeing my heart out, only moving for pistol barrage, and seemed to dodge and parry most of the bullets- making the fight a cake-walk.\nSo there you have it, happy soloing!',1753677,0,'0',0);

He also summons skeletons that can be killed very quickly, then shortly after they die, they ress themselves and can be killed again.

In addition, deals 1750 to 2250 Shadow damage to all enemies, knocking them down. 3 sec cast, 2 sec cooldown.\n\nBasically, you have to tank him away from the rest of your party, with his back to them, and as soon as you see him casting - the tank has to get the hell out of there (especially in phase 2) - or you run the risk of taking up to 23000 shadow damage in one hit.

When my mend pet starts to lose to Ingvar\'s melee damage, I run to the other side of the area and distracting shot to give it more time.  \n\nI beat down his first phase with my wolf about half health and then the fun part begins. His melee now hits harder and his smash can\'t be completely avoided.

I will update it for patch 4.0.3 but I will also retain the older version for the sake of comparison :).\n\n[b]Tips for Horde trying to get in (Patch 4.0.3):[/b] If you have a flying mount and are able to fly around the classic areas, then fly from http://DBURLHERE/?maps?data=148:484180446180468178538172553161564143 anywhere near Lor\'Danel in Darkshore , towards the Northwest. Orient yourself so that your arrow on your map is pointed towards some of the nearby islands of Teldrassil. Once the water stops being infinitely deep and there are signs of land, you will lose fatigue (you should only be fatigued for 10 seconds at the most at 280% speed).\n\nCLASSIC/OUTDATED:[b]Tips for Horde trying to get in:[/b]\n\nWhen I first started the WoW trial I was a NE priest, and later on moved onto horde. Feeling a bit homesick I decided to try and go out to Teldrassil on my 66 Tauren Hunter. Just thought I\'d share this for any other horde members wanting to invade or just explore and have fun.\n\n[u]STEPS:[/u][ol][li]First thing\'s first: Fly to Zoramgar Outpost. If you don\'t have the FP for it, just hop over to Splintertree post and walk West, or head to Crossroads and walk North.[/li][li]Second: Head west of Astranaar and north towards Darkshore.[/li][li]Take the road up and ride to Auberdine. As you pass near the edges you should see the port, and some pathways over the water. These are the ports for the ships that will take you to Teldrassil and other places.[/li][li]Get to the ports and RUN past the guards. They are only level 40/45 but if you don\'t want to get flagged, then avoid combat. They won\'t hurt and usually will ignore you once you\'re far away, just like any other mob. The boat to Teldrassil should be on the right (purple-ish color).[/li][li]Enjoy the boat ride over for a brief moment, but as you turn up at the port, jump into the water and head west a teeny bit. You should be able to see the pink portal leading into Darnassus.[/li][li]Run into the portal, there are 4 guards watching over it and you\'ll be facing more enemies once you enter, so best just to make your life easier.[/li][li]Once you are through the portal, you should be in Darnassus (the main city in Teldrassil). Immediately you will have guards on your tail, so run, jump into the lake, feign death (if you\'re a hunter like me), or anything else to avoid them or if you feel like, take them on.[/li][li]Watch out for ally level 70 players in Darn as well as level 65 guards and high level elite guards.[/li][li]The exit should be to the north. Find your way out or stay. The exit is guarded by 2 level 65 guards and there\'s 1 patrol that comes up on the pathway.[/li][li]ENJOY! Head over to the NE starting area and mess with the newbies. I was running around killing boars and cats and stuff and this Level 4 NE druid happened to see me. He started attacking me (I was flagged for killing a level 65 guard) and I decided to dance to mock him. I ended up dismounting and having my pet cat dash up and claw him (since he was on defense). He went down in 1 shot and I couldn\'t stop laughing. It\'s awesome.[/li][/ol]Hope that helps! :)',391205,0,'0',0);

After the cataclysmic events that followed the invasion of the Burning Legion, the Circle of Ancients and powerful druids combined their powers to grow an immense new world tree on Teldrassil. They called the tree Teldrassil, meaning "crown of the earth" in their native tongue. The night elves made their new home in the boughs of Teldrassil, creating a forest of mighty trees and flowing rivers, bathed in the endless night that fell over the lands of the elves from the dawn of time. However, the calm of the enchanted forest has slowly fallen into the shadow of a sinister presence. Crazed furbolgs and fouler beasts have appeared in Teldrassil, and it occupies all the attention of the vigilant Sentinels and the wise druids to ensure the safety of their new home.\n\nA sprawling city of moonstone and wood, the night elf capital of Darnassus stands as a shining beacon atop Teldrassil. Within its mighty walls are housed countless druids, hunters, and warriors, led by the priestess of Elune, Tyrande Whisperwind. A stunning marvel to the ability of night elven craftsmen, the ethereal Temple of the Moon rises above the tree line, balanced by the druids\' meticulously cultivated meditative grove. Trade from the main continent bustles through the city\'s trade quarter, where night elves, dwarves and humans alike haggle for wares and services. Delicate bridges and pathways crisscross the serene waterways of the city, the pristine waters reflecting the glowing light from the moons above. \n\nTaken from http://www.blizzard.com/wow/townhall/teldrassil.shtml http://www.blizzard.com/wow/townhall/teldrassil.shtml  \n\nTo ya\'ll needing to search :)',15068,0,'0',0);

I figured this out while mulling over going through the portal on my lvl 66 rogue, fully aware that doing so meant certain death...then I remembered the time when I fell off Teldrassil on one of my Nelf alts...Teldrassil isn\'t an instance when you go through the portal in Rut\'theran...it really is on top of that stump, and believe me, falling off proved it.\n\nSO! My method is this:\n\n1) Do as directed by LurkerPatrol...take the flightpath to either Zoram\'gar Outpost, or if you don\'t mind flying over mountains, you can fly to Whisperwind Grove in Felwood; then fly your way to Lor\'danel.\n\n2) Stop at the bit of land that goes furthest in the direction of Teldrassil on your map, right before you get to Lor\'danel...then fly your way in the direction of Teldrassil. You will likely reach shallow water right as your fatigue bar is halfway empty.\n\n3) If you stayed on track, you should be able to see Rut\'theran Villiage just a little northwest of you as you approach. Straight ahead of you should be one of the roots connected directly to the tree. Go to that root and stop to take a breath if you want...Once you\'re ready, follow the root to the base of the tree...then start flying up!\n\n4) Once you\'ve made your way up(Trust me, it takes longer to fly up Hyjal than to scale Teldrassil), you should be south of Lake Al\'Ameth. If you don\'t have the entire area of Teldrassil already on your map, go ahead and explore! If you\'re like me and only have to explore Darnassus, take a breath and move on.\n\n5) Head east, passing over Gnarlpine Hold, passing over the mountains until you see a little lake with a dock and a boat on it. Once you pass over this, you\'ll be in Darnassus territory(and thus flagged). Do NOT enter the city. INSTEAD, follow the edges of the tree as you pass into the Darnassus boarders. You will first discover Tradesmen\'s Terrace...then The Temple Gardens as you pass around the back of the Temple of the Moon. Once you make your way around the Temple, you\'ll see the pink portal...if you continue to follow the edges of the tree, and skirt your way into the Darnassus territory, you SHOULD gain your Explore Teldrassil achievement right here.\n\n6) Take a moment to pat yourself on the shoulder for a sneaky job well done, then drop out of the Darnassus territory, and then find yourself a nice branch to perch on until your PVP timer runs out, then you\'re free to go!\n\nI know I did this as a rogue, but I assure you I did none of it under stealth. I simply skirted the boarder on my flying mount until I got my achievement. I didn\'t even see any of the flying Sentinels, and think I was in a place where I wouldn\'t be noticed at all by players.\n\nAnyway, there you go! How to get into Teldrassil without dying!

As well as being a somewhat decent area for leveling, EPL was a "world PvP" zone, in which players could fight each other and capture towers for a zone buff.\n\nQuests were a bit scattered throughout the higher levels zones, but EPL had a fairly decent concentration of quests mainly in the lights hope chapel area making it a popular destination for most players.\n\nIn burning crusade, the eastern plaugelands remained unchanged, albeit woefully neglected by players.\nThis changed with the introduction of Wrath of the Lich King, and the entrance of death knights into the game.\n\nThe Lich King had decided to stage his conquest from the coast of EPL because the majority of his forces remained there in waiting while he was busy playing with spiders in northrend.\n\nBut on the whole EPL remained untouched until cataclysm.\n\nWith cataclysm sweeping changes came to "lower level areas." most quests were augmented if not entirely cut out, and replaced with newer, more interesting and relevant quests chains. EPL was not spared the axe in this area.\nWorld PvP points were removed, as well as the zone buff.\n\nWhereas before it contained, what was considered a small amount of quests was updated and outfitted with massively long chain quests, the primary chain quest is centered around an adventure between http://DBURLHERE/?npc=45730 Gidwin Goldbraids   and http://DBURLHERE/?npc=45429/tarenar-sunstrike Tarenar Sinstrike. \n\nBoth of whom have aspirations to become knights of the argent crusade, and you will help them. Along the way, after much sighing and smashing your head into your fist; you will complete the chain.\n\nThe whole area, today, in 4.3.0 is quite an interesting area.

This temple sits on one of the tallest peaks, right along the western border, so just beyond it the cliffs drop to Icecrown Glacier.

Previously, the city was believed to be nearly entirely concealed within the mountainscape, but this has now been proven untrue. Large sections of the city are visible aboveground. \n\nInside, Ulduar is a profusion of tunnels and stairs and balconies. The entire place appears to be carved out of a massive cave, and many of the levels are natural ledges. It has the feeling, as if nature were improved upon rather than replaced or recreated. The surfaces are a strange mix of smooth and unaltered stone and ice, as when a master sculptor works in stone and lets the materials natural texture add depth and beauty.

Travelers do not need to go there for passage north or south  they can stick to the Grizzly Hills, which surround ZulDrak on both sides and reach all the way up to Crystalsong Forest and the Storm Peaks. The only reason anyone would want to visit ZulDrak is if they were explorers hoping to meet the Drakkari  and they better have a large group of armed warriors with them when they do.[1] \n\nThe Drakkari have recently gone mad after they sacrificed their animal gods in an attempt to fight off the Scourge.

You can\'t get inside as a ghost or wisp because there\'s an invisible wall behind the gate. Simply get someone to fear you through the invisible wall. I find the easiest way to duel an Alliance player with some sort of fear or a Polymorph, and running into the corner of the gate. In most cases, a fear will make you run away from the caster. The Polymorph method can take a few tries.\n\nThe names of the inside areas are already stated in their somewhat chronological order in the comment above.\n\nRight inside the entrance is the [i]Well of the Forgotten[/i]. You can follow the the [i]Pauper\'s Walk[/i] down to a general [i]crypt[/i] area with functional doors to a few small crypt chambers. Moving further down the Pauper\'s Walk, you\'ll pass a room with uneven earth mounds stacked up, and further moving into [i]The Upside-down Sinners[/i]. As stated by WoWWiki, a large waterfilled chamber with corpses bound to sturdy chains. There is now several paths to follow beyond the water. In one area you\'ll find [i]The Slough of Despair[/i], which is a dark pit-like area. A different, more subtle route will lead you to the [i]Tome of the Unrepentant[/i] and [i]The Pit of Criminals[/i]. Both of these areas have longer bodies of shallow water covering the main ground, while the latter also has a huge pile of bones in one of the corners. There\'s some stairs leading up to the area above these last two chambers, where you can choose to drop back down into the Tome of the Unrepentant from an awning surrounding that room.\n\nIf you jump into the Well of the Forgotten, you will drop onto the huge pile of bones in The Pit of Criminals with under 1% health left (or about 30% if you\'re a rogue). This was probably thought out to serve some quicker way of getting back after a wipe, and it\'s by far one of the coolest things in the game. Be sure to have 100% health before attempting this, or getting your corpse back might become a problem.\n\nWhether this crypt was supposed to be an instance or not is not known by many.

A long time ago the [i]Dragon Queen Alexstrasza [/i]was captured by the [i]Demon Soul [/i]wielded by [i]Nekros Skullcrusher[/i], a foul Orc Warlock. [i]Deathwing "The Destroyer", Aspect of the Black Dragonflight [/i]and known before as[i] Neltharion the Earth-Warder[/i], was on his way to kill her . [i]Rhonin, leader of the Kirin\'tor[/i], was appointed to the task to free Alexstrasza from her prison. He needed the aid of the dragon [i]Korialstrasz[/i], mate of Alexstrasza, in his human form [i]Krasus[/i] (remember Krasus\' Landing in Dalaran?). Korialstrasz tried to contact the other dragon aspects, [i]Malygos, Nozdormu, and Ysera[/i], realizing only with their help could the black dragon be defeated. Their response was not really encouraging and Krasus was afraid he would lose his beloved Dragon Queen. When the final battle at Grim Batol began, Korialstrasz assumed dragon form once more and made haste in order to recapture the Demon Soul from Nekros Skullcrusher. Nekros tried to use the Demon Soul on him but despite its great power, Korialstrasz was able to break free. Weakened, he dropped to the earth where he summoned Rhonin to him and asked him to do this task. The three Dragon Aspects arrived and healed Korialstrasz, then battled Deathwing. The battle took a turn for the worse until Rhonin destroyed the Demon Soul and the Aspects could now attack with their full power. Deathwing was no match for their combined might, and fled. Korialstrasz was reunited with his Queen and, after gathering up her unhatched children, they disappeared off into the night.\n\nDid you know that:\n- Rhonin can still be found in Dalaran in the Violet Citadel\n- The Dragon Queen and her mate stay in their humanoid form as much as possible, only showing their inner dragon power when desperate\n- Deathwing is the father of the well known Onyxia\n- Nozdormu is the leader of the Bronze Dragonflight, who are the masters of time and rule the Caverns of Time\n- Ysera is Alexstrasza\'s younger sister\n- Grim Batol is one of Blizzard\'s favorite places and is often discussed in panels. Perhaps they will bring Grim Batol \'back\' into the game...\n\nThis is the Battle of Grim Batol in a nutshell. A lot of this piece of lore can be found throughout the game.

Made for levels 23 to 26 Shaman.\n\n(Required : One Copper tube and One Stormwind Seasoning Herbs)\nPART ONE\nIf you arrive from Redridge(north east) and head southwest to Darkshire,remember to set hearthstone. it is a good idea to pick  up the quests "Delivieries to Sven, Seasoned Wolf Kabobs", "The totem of affliction", "The Hermit", "Raven hill", "The legend of stalavan", "Look to the skies" and "The night watch". It Is best to head south, to Tranquil gardens cemetery and compleate "The Night Watch" and "Look to the skies".\nHead back to Darkshire, hand compleated quests, and and pick up "The Night Watch" and "Look to the skies".\n\nPART TWO\nHead west, and follow the path to the night watch camp located in west to dead central Duskwood and pick up quest "Eight legged manaces". Continue west along the path to Raven Hill. Talk to Jitters, who is just off the path that leads to Raven Hill, and hand In the quest "Raven Hill" and pick up "Jitters growling Gut". Head north east and find Abercrombie who Is just up a hill east of Raven Hill. On the way you should kill mobs for "The night watch". Once you are at Abercrombie you should hand in quests "The Hermit" and pick up "Supplies from Darkshire". Head west In an arc to avoid the higher level mobs, unless you are cabable of killing them, to find Lars. Pick up quest "Wolves at our heels".Sven Is right net to Lars, hand in quest "Deliveries for Sven".\nYou now have three quets that involve killing wolves and spiders, compleate them.\nHearthstone.\n\nPART THREE\nYou will now be In Darkshire, hand in quests "The Night Watch, "Seasoned Wolf Kabobs","Jitters growling gut" "Supplies from Darkshire and If you have compleated it, "The totem of afflication". Pickup quests : "Look to the skies", "Ghost hair thread", "The night watch" and "Dusky crab cakes".\n\nPART FOUR\nHead south east, to a place north of Tranquil Gardens Cematary, and find Blind Mary. Hand In quests "Ghost Hair Thread" and "Look to the stars". Pickup quests "Look to the stars" and "Return the comb". Head back to Darkshire, hand In "Return the comb" and pickup "Deliver the thread".\n\nPART FOUR\nHead back to Raven Hill, If you see any spiders, kill them. Find Abercrombie again and hand In "Deliver the thread",pickup "Zombie Juice" then head west and compleate "The night watch". If you still have not compleated "Dusky Crab cakes" or "The totom of affliction" - do it now, there are zombies in raven hill and spiders by the river and to the very west of Duskwood. Once these quests are done, Hearthstone and hand In "Zombie juice", "The totem of affliction", "Dusky Crab cakes" and "The Night watch"\n\nPART FIVE (Optional)\nYou should have a few quests left over, I diddn\'t compleate them but If you are stuck or want to stay In the wonderous Duskwood, compleating them Is but a trip to Raven Hill away. If you stick with the Svens revenge questline and The legend of Stalavans questline, you should eventualy find your way In the Wetlands, a good place to move next.',7332,0,'0',0);

Unknown events occurred and the Scythe found its way to the mine now known as Roland\'s Doom.What happened to her after that is unclear, but it is likely she was killed by something that did not approve of her actions.\nDue to events central to the Scythe of Elune, Duskwood is a cursed, dying land.Its effects have transformed what was once a beautiful part of Elwynn Forest into a land covered in gnarled trees and inhabited by the hideous undead and extradimensional Worgen,and, before the Cataclysm, some of the most powerful members of the Defias Brotherhood.\nThe militia of Duskwood, known as the Night Watch, patrol the main thoroughfare and protect Darkshire(former Grand Hamlet), wary of anything moving through the shadows. \nhttp://www.wowwiki.com/Duskwood http://www.wowwiki.com/Duskwood ',1876314,0,'0',0);
