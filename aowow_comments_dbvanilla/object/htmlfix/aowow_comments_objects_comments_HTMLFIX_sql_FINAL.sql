(need 120 herbs)\nlvl 75-100 - Briarthorn, Bruiseweed, Mageroyal, Stranglekelp, Swiftthistle - farm south of river in SIlverpine you will get mostly Briarthorn or Stonetalon Mountain will get all herbs apart from Stranglekelp and Wild Steelbloom (need 70 herbs).\n\nMy experience of each zone is you will get the necessary herbs quicker in Silverpine and it is close to the next zone you need. However, Stonetalon also gives a good return but is slightly slower but the advantage is you will get herbs you need for the next level.\n\nlvl 100-150 - Grave Moss, Kingsblood, Liferoot, Wild Steelbloom - You can do this in either Wetlands or Arathi Highlighands (need 230 herbs)\n\nMy experience is you will find less competition in Wetlands and you will get to next level quicker as you will only find the necessary herbs in this zone. Arathi Highlands will also give herbs you need for the next level and you need to travel less to get there.\n\nlvl 150-200 - Fadeleaf, Goldthorn, Khadgar\'s Whisker, Wintersbite - Don\'t worry about Wintersbite as not enough of it around. Best zones for this are Arathi Highlands or Stranglethorn Vale. (need 210 herbs)\n\nMy experience is that you may get slightly less herbs in Arathi but you will get them quicker as you have shorter distance to travel, also less variation on what herbs you will find. You will also need to travel less distance to get there (assuming you use zones suggested above)\n\nlvl 200-250 - Arthas\'s Tear, Blindweed, Firebloom, Ghost Mushroom, Gromsblood, Purple Lotus, Sungrass. You can try either Swamp of Sorrows or Hinterlands (need 190 herbs)\n\nIf you go to Swamp of Sorrows you will find a lot of Blindweed Fast and once you finish your route you can go to Badlands and farm Gromsblood and FIrebloom before heading back to Swamp of Sorrows. If you go to Hinterlands you will get a lot of Sungrass and Purple Lotus but the downside is that unless you are high level you will need to do a lot of fighting to get the stuff in the troll bases. If you decide on Swamp of Sorrows use the portal to Badlands to get there to save time.\n\nlvl 250-290 - Dreamfoil, Golden Sansam, Icecap, Moutain Silversage,Plaguebloom - There are 3 zones you could try Un\'Goro Crater, Winterspring and Hellfire Peninsula (need 110 herbs)  \n\nWhat zone you decide on will depend on your level. If you are below 55 go Un\'goro and travel round the edge and you will get a lot of Moutain Silversage and a little Dreamfoil and Golden Sansam. If you are between 55-58 go to Winterspring and you will get a lot of herbs. If you are able to go to Hellfire then do it and if you have epic flying it will be very fast and you will also get the herbs you need for the next level.\n\nlvl 290-350 - Ancient Lichen, Dreaming Glory, Felweed, Mana Thistle, Netherbloom, Nightmare Vine, Ragveil, Terocone - (need 250 herbs)\n\nBy far best place is Terrokar Forrest as the place is abundant in herbs.

My function is to offer access to and, when permissible, insight into informations regarding the Creators\' synthesis of the Earthen on the world designated as Azeroth. I am ready to share this information with you now at your leisure.[ul][li]Who are the Earthen?[/li][/ul]The Earthen are a synthesized race engineered by the Creators, functioning as one of the seed races in the initial population of the world designated as Azeroth. The Earthen were created to aid the Creators\' efforts in shaping the deep regions of this world.\n\nThey are a modification of the standard subterranean being matrix used on other worlds that the Creators have seeded. The construction of this prototype race created various anomalies that were observed after initial synthesis.[ul][li]What is a \'subterranean being matrix\'?[/li][/ul]It is one of the synthesis matrices the Creators use when seeding a world. Each synthesis matrix is used to achieve the Creators\' goals. For Azeroth, a subterranean being matrix was modified to create a being with increased durability with an affinity for deep region shaping; the Earthen are the product of this modification.\n\nAfter the Earthen had been put into service for the Creators, unforeseen anomalies were discovered that affected their synthesis matrix due to high-stress environments.[ul][li]What are the anomalies you speak of?[/li][/ul]Additional background information on the Earthen must be given to you before this question may be answered properly. Processing.\n\nTo understand the anomalies of the Earthen, it is first important to understand what the Earthen represent in their design intent. The Earthen represent the Creators\' attempt at improving the survivability paradigm of the standard subterranean being matrix. This was done by incorporating a resilient foundation of construction inherent to the world into said matrix.[ul][li]What is a resilient foundation of construction?[/li][/ul]It is the baseline material used in race synthesis. A cross-section of Azeroth\'s crust was used as the foundation for the Earthen\'s synthesis rather than the typical biomass construction foundation used by the Creators.\n\nResearch on the world\'s composition led the Creators to theorize that an enhanced being could be synthesized that would epitomize the resiliency of this world\'s essence. This was accomplished by choosing to use a blend of Azeroth\'s various stone core compounds as the foundation.[ul][li]So... the Earthen were made out of stone?[/li][/ul]Simply stated, this is correct.\n\nThe Earthen\'s physical features are that of a smaller stature humanoid, though their composition is that of Azeroth\'s various stone core compounds. Their design maximizes strength and stamina without sacrificing cognitive processing power. Their skin and musculature are nearly impervious to physical damage, and with very minor modifications the Earthen display a remarkable resiliency to unwanted magical forces.[ul][li]Anything else I should know about the Earthen?[/li][/ul]It is integral to the assimilation of this data that it is understood that the Creators wanted to synthesize a race that would long be an integral part of this world\'s development cycle after they had departed. This race would be instrumental in fulfilling the Creators\' long-term development objectives for Azeroth.\n\nAs an ancillary note, the nomenclature ""Earthen"" was deemed apropos for the new race by the Creators, based on the Earthen\'s composition.[ul][li]I think I understand the Creators\' design intent for the Earthen now. What are the Earthen\'s anomalies that you spoke of earlier?[/li][/ul]The Earthen\'s only anomaly in synthesis is the tendency for matrix destabilization while being utilized in high-stress environments.\n\nAddendum: Deep earth sculpting was naturally suited to the new matrix design and thus never met the qualifications of duplicating a high-stress environment.\n\nDestabilization was not discovered until well into the Earthen\'s primary service cycle for the Creators.

You may also request this information from another information repository located on Azeroth.[ul][li]What happens when the Earthen destabilize?[/li][/ul]There are two potential results when the Earthen\'s synthesis matrix destabilizes. Initiating visual aid representation number one.\n\nThe first variant matrix is a degenerative product of synthesis, hereby designated with the common nomenclature of ""Trogg"". This variant maintains strength and stamina comparable to the Earthen, but its cognitive processing power has been almost completely compromised. Force of will and a strong sense of cunning are the only driving factors in the psyche of the trogg.[ul][li]Troggs? Are the troggs you mention the same as the ones in the world today?[/li][/ul]I am unable to process your chronological reference in comparison to the recording of this data, my apologies.\n\nThe trogg retains some composition of Azeroth\'s various stone core compounds, but the loss of cognitive power makes this variant unacceptable to the Creators.\n\nThe trogg procreates as per a standard biomass. By default it consumes stone and anything else it can acquire, including other troggs. Cannibalism is considered unacceptable by the Creators.[ul][li]You mentioned two results when the Earthen destabilize. What is the second?[/li][/ul]Initiating visual aid representation number two.\n\nThe second resultant variance of the Earthen matrix retains many desired elements when compared to the standard subterranean matrix. The common nomenclature for this variant is ""Dwarf"".\n\nThis variant retains strength and stamina inherent to the Earthen. In some cases, the dwarf even exceeds the cognitive powers of the Earthen\'s matrix. The dwarf, however, retains none of the physical composition of Azeroth\'s various stone core compounds.[ul][li]Dwarves! Now you\'re telling me that dwarves originally came from the Earthen?[/li][/ul]The data stored in this repository does indeed correlate with your astute proclamation.\n\nThe dwarf maintains an affinity for the stone composition of Azeroth, but due to the high-stress environmental anomaly within the Earthen\'s synthesis matrix, the dwarf reverts to a default biomass composition as seen in the standard subterranean matrix.\n\nErgo, the dwarf variant does synthesize from the degeneration of the Earthen creation matrix, as you inferred with your query.',377720,0,'0',0);

Dwarves eat and procreate through means typical to other standard biomasses.\n\nThe Creators view the dwarf as an acceptable variant, worthy of genesis in its own right.[ul][li]Who are the Creators?[/li][/ul]The Creators are... the Creators.\n\nThey are the beings that seeded and shaped this world by their own design.

The more samples (i.e. more people submitting their results), the more accurate it gets. \n\nSecond, and more importantly, a drop rate is not a linear percentage. If the drop rate is 10%, it does [i]not[/i] mean you will get 1 out of 10, 10 out of 100 and so on. You can, but you can also easily get more or less than 10% in such a limited sample size. What it [i]does[/i] mean, is that should you farm enough of these items, you will end up finding that 10% to be accurate. \n\nIf you\'re confused, picture it this way. Take a 20-sided die, roll it 10 times, and count how many times you roll a 1 or a 2. As far as chance goes, that\'s also a 10% chance; but the number of times you actually roll a 1 or a 2, may vary. It could be zero, it could be 4, but the chance is still 10%. Now if you were to roll that same die 1000 times, you\'re far more likely to roll a 1 or a 2, 10% of the time - but even then, it\'s not a guarantee. \n\nThat\'s how pretty much any rate in an MMO goes. Every time you loot a corpse, attack, or farm a node, an invisible die gets rolled, where X% of the total possible results ends up delivering what you\'re looking for. That percentage is the drop/proc rate, or chance.',1643775,0,'0',0);

You only need to kill the first 4 bosses, but one thing: don\'t forget to release the prisoners.  We almost forgot tonight, and I had to ride back to 3rd boss just before we did 4th.  Yoiks.  Still had 9 mins or so when we finished, and I think we had 11-12 last night.  Both nights the bear dropped (I know that\'s a small sample but anecdotally I think the drop rate is 100%) so we\'re all set now.  I wish Zul\'Gurub were so giving.  I did die tonight to one of the bosses (I forget which one) as I was distracted and let the boss get to me instead of my pet.  I would hazard the opinion that if you\'re around 515+ ilvl soloing would be simple, and duoing as the wife and I did would be trivial.\nAnother note: neither of us had actually ever completed the rescue the prisoner\'s quest, so last night, it was an actual quest to finish that.

This will ensure that you do not waste any time lingering after a move so as to maximize the amount of time you can spend waiting for the Recently In Game debuff to wear off. Make sure you plan your next move during those 10 secs, and position yourself near the piece you want to move next. The chat option to control a piece will only be available as soon as the debuff wears off completely.[/li][/ul][ul][li][b]Secondary move(s)[/b]: Start by moving your pawns up one space. If you\'re unsure which pawns to start with, move the ones in front of your knights. Then move each rook into the space in front of each knight. This will capitalize on the range of the rook\'s AoE (leaving a rook ""against a wall"" wastes the range of its AoE).[/li][/ul][ul][li][b][b]Don\'t stand in the fire![/b][/b]: After approximately 2 mins, http://DBURLHERE/?npc=16816 Medivh  will cheat. Medivh only has two ways of cheating: dropping fire under 3-4 of your pieces, or http://DBURLHERE/?spell=39342 buffing  3-4 enemy pieces with double damage. Medivh will always drop fire first, and he will always drop fire under your king. Make sure you\'re free from the Recently In Game debuff at around the 2 mins mark so that you can control your king right away and move him to a ""not so hot"" tile. After your king is safe, try to save your other ""hot"" pieces if you can. After another 2 mins, Medivh will buff a few enemy pieces, doubling their damage output for 1 min. You can avoid these pieces if you wish, but it is better to face them and attack them if they are attacking your pieces.[/li][/ul][ul][li][b]Healing is vital[/b]: Your bishops have an ability that heals a piece for 12000 HP. Taking the time to heal your king (your king will definitely need a few heals throughout the game) or another piece will determine whether you win or lose, so factor in a few moves for healing. The healing ability itself has a >10s CD, so once you heal the piece you need to, right click the Control Piece buff and make your next move.[/li][/ul][ul][li][b]Assess, react, checkmate[/b]: The key to victory in the Chess Event is movement. After you\'ve made your primary and secondary moves as suggested above, the rest of your moves are entirely up to you. During the downtime between moves, always scan the board and make a quick, wise decision on what your next move will be. Try not to focus-fire the enemy\'s king right off the bat; use the majority of your pieces to cull the rest of your enemy\'s pieces (leave your king and three other pieces to deal with the enemy king).[/li][/ul]I hope these tips help!\nGood luck!\n\n[small]P.S.: My fastest checkmate so far took me 4:15 mins (six pawns were taken for either side, and I had taken an enemy bishop and the king).

Once they are pulled, each of the horsemen automatically split up and head for a corner. You can build aggro on Rivendare and Thane while they move, but they don\'t react until after they make it to their corner. From the entrance side, Thane goes to the close left corner, Rivendare goes to the close right corner, Lady B goes to the back left corner, and Sir Z goes to the back right corner. Considering Sir Zeliek\'s main attack is Holy Bolt and Lady B\'s main attack is Shadow Bolt, which do ~2450 damage each, you don\'t need a plate wearing tank to tank them. A warlock/DK combo is preferred, since they have abilities that can damage and also heal themselves and have defensive counter abilities to those spell schools (Warlock for Shadow and DK for magic in general). Sir Z and Lady B remain stationary and cannot be moved and normally attack the closest person.\n\nAssign one healer to cover the Rivendare tank and one healer for the Thane tank. The back will require significantly less healing than the front, so you may assign just 1 or 2 healers (off-spec acceptable) to keep up the tanks in the back.\n\nIf you\'re not going for the achievement, http://DBURLHERE/?achievement=2176 And They Would All Go Down Together (N) , it\'s recommended to burn Thane down first using cooldowns and bloodlust/heroism and then Rivendare. It\'s likely that Rivendare won\'t fall, unless you are all over-geared. Once you hit 3-4 marks, all of the melee DPS should go to Lady B and the rest of the DPS go to Sir Zeliek. The Thane tank+healer should relieve the Rivendare tank+healer, who then relieve the Zeliek tank (+healer), who then relieve Lady B\'s tank (+healer). Once the original Rivendare tank+healer lose their Marks from Rivendare, they should relieve the current Rivendare tank+healer after the next mark.\n\nSpecial note for Thane: He does a http://DBURLHERE/?spell=28884 meteor  that can be lethal if it only hits one person, especially combined with a high number of marks. It\'s recommended that everyone stands within a pack of other players, so the meteor damage is split with them (when I tanked it, the most I ever seen it hit for is 8k).\n\nSpecial note for Sir Zeliek: It\'s recommended that your raid should form tight groups of 2 people that are spaced 15+ yards away from each other. The reason for this is because he has a http://DBURLHERE/?spell=28883 Holy Wrath  ability that grows in damage by 50% each time it bounces and can bounce to lethal levels, chaining and wiping out the raid. Just like Blaumeux has a void zone, Rivendare has his DoT, and Thane has his meteor, this is Zeliek\'s signature move. It\'s instant cast and is cast at about a frequency of roughly once every 15 seconds. If you simply tell everyone to spread out, that\'s just an invitation for the Holy Wrath to play connect the dots as people will spread out maybe 5-10 yards from each other and create a path for the Holy Wrath (it\'s bounce range is 10 yards).\n\nSpecial note for healing in the back: If you have 2 ranged DPS tanking them, then the healer can stay out of the marks altogether by standing by where the chest spawns and having the tanks stand ~20 yards away from the boss, towards the center platform. They will be tank as long as they are the closest person to the boss.\n\nBe ware to always have at least 1 person within 30 yards of them at all times, else they will do 6k damage to the entire raid (http://DBURLHERE/?spell=57381 Unyielding Pain  and http://DBURLHERE/?spell=57377 Condemnation ), so healers let the tanks run by first and once the other tank is in range of their new target, you complete the swap.\n\nEveryone will need to avoid being caught in too many marks. Everyone in the front by Rivendare and Thane should note that marks are applied every 10 seconds within a 55 yard range (at approximately the 0:15 mark on the debuff timer). Everyone in the back by Lady B and Zeliek should note that marks are applied every 12+ seconds within a 45 yard range (which is not rare to have a mark stack fall off if your resist one).\n\nSafe spot from marks in the back: If you can picture where the chest spawns, it\'s between that and the very top of the steps. So roughly 5 yards towards the center of the platform after climbing the stairs. To make use of this safe spot as a healer, you must have ranged tank the Sir Z and Lady B. Here is me standing in the spot on our latest attempt: http://i41.tinypic.com/11bn77t.jpg http://i41.tinypic.com/11bn77t.jpg \n\nIf you are going for the achievement, here is the general strategy:\n\nRivendare: 1 tank, 1 healer, 1 DPS (pref melee).\nThane: 1 tank, 1 healer, 1 DPS (pref melee).\nZeliek: 1 DPS, 1 off-spec healer.\nBlaumeux: 1 DPS, 1 off-spec healer.\n\nSome alterations you can make here in the composition are:\n- 3 ranged DPS in the back with 1 properly spec\'d healer, using the tactics noted early in which the healer may stay out of the marks altogether.\n- If you have a properly spec\'d healer in the back, it really doesn\'t matter who tanks in the back, as long as there\'s healing done and they don\'t stand in Blaumeux\'s void zones or clump up and allow the Zeliek\'s Holy Wrath to chain. If you don\'t have a properly spec\'d healer, then you\'d want your tanks to be able to mitigate damage and/or heal themselves (warlock, DK, mage, etc.).\n\nThe Rivendare and Thane groups stay in their corners. Every 3 marks, their tanks run towards each other and use their 30 yard single target taunt to taunt each other\'s bosses and bring them back to their corner. Beware of meteors and do not let DPS chase the bosses any further than the tank. Zeliek and Blaumeux groups will swap sides every 3 marks.\n\nRivendare and Thane will likely be brought down to 15% first with the back at about 25%. Have the DPSers for Thane and Rivendare swap to this point and get Zeliek and Blaumeux to 5% and then return to Thane and Rivendare. Once all bosses are lingering around 5%, the raid leader should make the call to finish them off. It\'s useful to have a raid boss mod such as Deadly Boss Mods to track health. Note with DBM, the boss\'s health may say 0%, but they aren\'t dead until the bar says dead, unlike with the mini-bosses at Thaddius.',472872,0,'0',0);

To make things easier, C and D should also trade places at this time as well to avoid vent chatter, however their mobs don\'t really require taunting as they are range only caster bosses.

You can safely move around them anywhere in the room by hugging the wall before the fight starts, so get into position, then have the MT start it. Each horseman goes to a corner of the room when the fight starts. All horsemen MUST have someone in attack range when the fight starts and at all times during the fight or they will insta-gib the raid. You need 2 self healing classes in the back to deal with the nuker mobs. DK, ret pally, warlock, any healer will do. You need 1 tank, 1 healer, and split the remaining dps for both of the front/melee type mobs. So thats 4 seperate groups for this fight. The 2 people the back just focus on living and position swapping, the groups in the front focus on dps and position swapping.\n\nThe trick to this fight is the stacking debuff/damage. Every 8 seconds or so, all the horsemen will apply their individual mark to everyone in a 45 yard radius. 1-3 marks is very safe. 4-5 is pushing it. 7+ and youre dead. The marks will fall off after 20 seconds. So what you do is right when the 3rd mark is applied, both sides of the room switch positions. The group who was DPS\'ing the thane now dps\' baron, and the baron group dps\' the thane. Same with the back, the person who was dps\'ing the lady now dps\' zelik, and the person dps\'ing zelik swaps to the lady. Since the lady and zelik never move once in position, swapping is easy. Just run to your new target and dps. The melee tanks just need to run to the new position, and taunt the new target on the way by each other. Classes with a taunt but not tanking should have it on their bar just in case. One resisted taunt can wipe the raid.\n\nOnce you have the position swapping every 20-25 seconds down, fight is trivial.

Thane and Rivendare get corner swapped until they are burned down and Zelnik and Blaumeux get target swapped. I have personally (as a paladin) handled the back two horsemen with the aid of a shadow priest one time and a hunter the other. Provided your back two can swap effectively, then mana really becomes the only thing keeping you from doing it all day long. Just to elaborate on the back two if it\'s a paladin+another;\n\n- hit each once then focus on surviving the attacks. A Paladin throwing beacon of light is a godsend for this. By only hitting the target once, you can easily switch aggro, regardless of who you have back there.\n\n- When they are grabbed, focus on being just inside the heal range (30 yards) If both of the back holders do this, they are still within the 45 yard control radius. Being in line with the pillars of the platform serves as a solid guideline.\n\n- Have someone monitor the mark counts on the back just like you have someone monitor the mark count at the front. During the fight, having these two monitors being the only ones calling out the switch keeps things nice and organized. When the switch occurs, I use that as the time to reapply the beacon.\n\n-When the front two are down, I\'ve found the easiest way to avoid confusion during the back two is not to break the switch pattern, but instead of focusing on survival, you can focus on standard roles.\n\n- Like a lot of enemies in naxx, the horsemen are classified as undead. As a paladin dealing with the back two, when I get the chance, usually with blameaux, I go all out on the offensive and throw any damage dealing abilities I have, as healing is usually pretty solid. This way there are fewer marks from blaumeux.\n\nPretty much, I found that a lot of the failed attempts usually stem from confusion leading to chaos.

Here\'s what I dwowhead:1,id:\n\nNote: I used my voidwalker for this part.\n\n-- Zone in, clear bridge, kill patrolling Skeleton. Hang left, pull pack of four at bottom of stairs. Very simple, they\'re all casters and as a warlock, you\'ll either be resisting/absorbing a lot of their damage (Shadow Ward).\n\n-- Head into the room with the Summoners (room adjoining Kirtonos\' room), kill the patrolling Skeletons/Spiders. At 70, you can just walk right down the center of the room and not aggro anything.\n\n-- Next room has a lot of groups, I recommend killing them all (except the mobs in the cubby holes) because you will need the space for kiting the Constructs/Rattlegore. Clearing will be easy, but beware runners, it\'s easy to have a mob run off and all of a sudden you\'ve pulled half the room (this happened to me, haha). I got careless and lived through it (had to Healthstone due to multiple silences), but it was completely avoidable. :P\n\n-- Clear the room of Whelps/Handlers, again need room for kiting later. Actually I left a pack in the far corner, but when I was kiting Rattlegore I accidentally aggroed a Whelp, so I recommend a full clear to be safe. Resist the urge to AoE the room. Do Line of Sight pulls and you will get them in groups of 3-4. DoT/drain tank.\n\n-- The Constructs hit hard, you do NOT want to get this guy in your face. Cleared one side of Rattlegore\'s room (left side), plus a couple of mobs near Rattle himself (getting adds with Rattle = game over). Pulled Constructs one at a time, sending Voidy in to tank them. Quickly dotted Construct up (every dot I could use) and ran the hell away, through the Whelp/Handler room, through the big room. Got aggro when Construct was 50%-ish, waited until it was in range, reapplied some DoTs and Shadowbolted it to death. Curse of Exhaustion is a godsend here, using it will ensure that Constructs will never touch you. :D\n\n-- Don\'t forget to check if patrols have respawned before you pull Constructs.\n\n-- Rattlegore will tear your face off if he gets in range, so number one priority is STAY THE HELL AWAY. Pulled Rattle, send Voidy to tank, load up with DoTs, then ran! Rattle needs a couple of rounds of DoTs, so I ran up the stairs, waited in a clear corner of the Whelp room, beside a hole in the floor. Got aggro after first round of DoTs, Rattle ran for me, got in range, I reapplied DoTs, then jumped down the hole (this is why I cleared a side of Rattle\'s room. Don\'t jump down the wrong side!). Rattle ran back downstairs, and by the time he got back down, he was around 10k health so I sacced the Voidy and mowed him down. Looted Viewing Room Key.\n\n-- Room of Ghouls/Aberrations: cleared patrolling Spiders, then pulled group (right of stairs) back into the big room. Had Voidy tag all the mobs, then DoT the Ghouls. Don\'t forget to stay out of the poison clouds when Ghoul dies. Aberrations are immune to magic damage, so I got a good laugh out of watching myself and Voidy duke it out with them. They only have 3k HP, but it still takes a minute. Pull group near Viewing Room door, same tactic.\n\n-- Enter Viewing Room and get the Flame!

Not raid-geared, but wearing a lot of high end crafted gear plus heroic items. Here\'s what I dwowhead:1,id:\n\n-- Zone in, fought the Gordok Brute that pats from the right.\n\n-- Went left, avoided the groups, came to the entrance of the second room. Pack of mobs in the doorway: two Mage-Lords/Brute. Waited for patrol coming from the right (Mage-Lord/Mastiff) and killed them.\n\n-- Pulled group in the doorway, sending voidy to Brute while I dotted up the two casters, then focused on keeping my voidy\'s HP up while he tanked Brute. You will get aggro from your voidy, but casters will be almost dead by then. Once I got aggro from the Brute, I sacced my voidy and killed him.\n\n-- Went into the Courtyard and waited for pats to clear. Ran up the ramp and got the Courtyard Key, unlocked the door. Kiilled the wandering Eye that pats in the hallway.\n\n-- Group of three: Warlock/Doomguard/Reaver. Cast Shadow Ward before you pull and Banish Doomguard, send pet to Reaver. As pet tanks Reaver, dot up Warlock and kill him. You should be resisting/absorbing his shadowbolts, so he is cake. Dot up the Reaver, heal up your pet a bit, take the Reaver down. If you get aggro, use Death Coil/Fear to buy you some time. Using Fear with this group is risky; I feared the Reaver and he ran to the Courtyard and brought back some dogs. I AoE feared them, Healthstoned, re-banished Doomguard, feared Reaver, killed dogs, popped a HP pot, killed Reaver, and kept banishing the Doomguard until I could bandage/heal pet, then killed Doomguard. Really Low on HP/mana after this. :P\n\n-- Did the same tactic as above with next group (minus bad fear :P)\n\n-- After this, there\'ll be a group of bugs. I sent the voidy in, a couple of Seeds of Corruption killed them.\n\n-- Killed the patrolling Eye, then waited for Slip\'kik to pat all the way to the right wall (in front of shackled goblin) and pulled. You have to kill him because Slip\'kik patrols all the way to the other side, and he will add when you are clearing over there -- this was my first (embarrassing) death. Pull Slip\'kik far back because he will call adds if he dies too close to other mobs. Dotted up Slip\'kik and after a round or two I got aggro, then just mowed him down as fast as I could, Healthstoned/Death Coiled.\n\n-- Around the bend, there are two Reavers. Pulled them back to the entrance of the room and had my voidy tank one while I feared the other, then killed the other one.\n\n-- Packs of four: two Warlocks/Doomguards. You can\'t sneak up the ramp. I tried it and aggroed the group, haha. I thought I was okay, but I feared a Doomguard and he bugged, running into another group at the end of the room. :D Embarrassing death number two. Cast Shadow Ward, pulled by banishing Doomguard, sent my voidy to a Warlock/other Doomguard, feared/CoEx the other Warlock, and dotted up both Warlocks while keeping up the voidy\'s HP over half. The Warlocks will die in a round or two of dots. Doomguard came out of Banish just as the Warlocks were being finished off, so I re-banished him and dotted up the other Doomguard. Voidy and I were low on HP/mana now, so I kept the last Doomguard banished until I bandaged/healed pet. Flame of Dire Maul was right at the top of the ramp.\n\n-- Last pull was a pack of three: Reaver/Warlock/Doomguard. Pulled the Reaver down the ramp, intending to Fear him and deal with the other two but the Eyes had respawned and I aggroed it! I panicked and thought I was screwed, so I dotted up the closest mob to me and decided to at least take him down before I died. But as I ran into the hallway, I saw that the Eye\'s spawns hadn\'t aggroed me, so I feared the Reaver, killed the pack of three in the hallway. Cleared the Voidwalker Spawns, killed the leftover Warlock/Doomguard. Looted the Flame and danced!',109928,0,'0',0);

Fortunately, [b]it is possible to skip the normally compulsory second, third and fourth bosses (Battleguard Sartura, Fankriss the Unyielding and Princess Huhuran).[/b] This will take you up to where enemies start dropping shards.\n\n[b]You must have a means of removing threat. You cannot just run past.[/b] Even if you don\'t pull Sartura yourself and she\'s at the other side of the room, she will aggro if you attempt to leave the other end of her room. As far as I can tell, she doesn\'t drop aggro from you moving a certain distance away from her original position. She was still following me half way down the corridor after the next boss (Fankriss), at which point I was caught and killed. \n\nFankriss will aggro as soon as you take a couple of steps into the room. It is essential that you use your method for threat loss as soon as you exit his room, as he has an ability (that he uses quite a lot, when soloing at least) that will teleport you into the corner of his room and stun you, even if you\'re halfway down the next corridor when he hits you with it. The trash in the next corridor also have an ability slows your movement speed, which is quite hard to avoid because of the sheer quantity of trash. It was because of the movement speed debuff that I was caught, ported and killed when I tried skipping without invisibility.\n\n[b]For the actual threat loss:[/b] Invisibility potions work. As a mage I was using the ability/talent Greater Invisibility. Threat losing abilities of other classes will no doubt also work. Note that Invisibility potions are on a separate cooldown from any class abilities that drop threat, which can be useful. \n\nIf you are using a threat loss method with a long cooldown (such as invisibility potions), you will still be able to skip the 3 bosses without waiting around for the cooldowns if you save it for after Fankriss. You must lose your threat after Fankriss because of the aforementioned movement speed debuff and subsequent teleportation and stun. You can run past Sartura on your mount, and she will follow you at about the same speed (so she never catches up), and lose threat after Fankriss to drop aggro from both of them. Huhuran you can maneuver around without ever picking up aggro.\n\nHopefully this information will save some of you the obscenely long corpse run for this instance.',1823152,0,'0',0);

And by honor, I do not mean the one you get from killing enemy players, I mean REAL honor, that touches your heart, and stays in your memory.\n\nI started from the memorial of Koiter, and I ended up reading stories, that put pain in my chest. I have played this game from around 7 years, and had no idea that there is so deep meaning in simple things like that. Which leads me to an idea, that will ease my pain, and most likely the pain of others.\n\nOn each of their respective birthdays, and the days that all of them have died, aswell during the Day Of The Dead, I will go to all of their memorials, and give respect to their deaths. I will bring along friends, and tell them who those people are, and how they died. It will be good from all of you, to do the same. Because, when few words are spoken, or wrote on a small piece of paper, they with ease fade into the abyss of time, but, when many, many words are wrote, they become a book, and a book, can be passed down with centuries and milleniums. We, the people that respect those who have died, are the words. Let us find more people, and make a whole book with them, so the honor of those who have died, be remembered for as long as possible.\n\nLet us now bow and kneel to the dead ones, because, no one shall escape from that, be it king, or be it simple harvester. I will post this around, and make more people see this. Let us do something, that we can be proud of, let us show to the families and close friends, that we, the ones that play this game, care a lot.\n\nP.S. : Message created by DarkTroll, a Private Server player, that cannot effort to play in Retail.

On the landing between the top floor and the bottom floor is an Ogre Tannin, which you need to make the suit. Grab this if you\'re a tailor or leatherworker, then enjoy the movie reference.\n\nGo talk to all the bosses to get your buffs(3% crit with spells, +15% total stamina, +200 attack power, all for 2 hours) also, talk to Stomper Kreeg(in the first room opposite side of the courtyard) to get free booze(if this is your first time) or buy some. He sells Volatile Rum, which is used for Goblin Rocket Fuel and can be sold for a good deal of money(at least on my server).\n\nThere\'s also a quest you can pick up from one of the ogres in the second room, to go kill the Prince in the Library. You\'ll need to also get a quest out of DM West, kill the Prince, then make another tribute run to turn it in. All in all though, a fun run. Good luck!',4918,0,'0',0);

Great loot, and quick. \n\nThe way I take this, which seems to work really well(we can run in about 45 minutes) This run requires a rogue, 1 frost oil, 1 thorium widget, 1 godok ogre suit(can be made by a tailor, leatherworker, or the goblin inside: mats are 2xbolt of runecloth, 4x rugged leather, 1x Ogre Tannin, 1x Rune Thread - note this can also  be made by the goblin Knot Thimblejack inside the instance for twice the mats[still only 1 ogre tannin though]):\n\nBoss 1 and 2: after coming in the instance door, clear the first pat and start heading left. Head into the next room(do not go down into the courtyard) where the boss pats around. It\'s pretty easy to keep an eye on the boss, and put a raid icon over his head to keep track of him. Have your rogue sneak into the center of the pavilion where the boss pats and snatch the key out of the chest. This takes some careful timing but isn\'t too hard. You should be going along the south wall, pull everything back to the southeast corner of the room as you make your way west, keeping an eye on the boss. Once you\'ve cleared the south wall walkway, let the boss pat down the stairs in front of you. When he goes back up everyone run to the southwest corner. You don\'t have to clear anything between here and the door. Head to the door in the middle of the west wall - watch out for the boss because he pats down here as well - if he does just run back untill he goes up the stairs then run thru the door.\n\nBoss 3: Slip\'kik is easy enough to avoid. After opening the door from the second room and heading down into the hallway, you\'ll find a group of ogres. Clear it out. As you move on to the next room you\'ll aggro a bunch of spiders and other insects. This is easy enough with AoE and you\'ll see it beforehand. Clear the entrance to the room. Now you should see a goblin in the far corner. We want to watch the timing on Slip\'kik and the Eye of Kilrogg that pats through this area. When they are both patted away, line-of-sight pull the two warlocks and the two deathguards that are standing around the bonfire in front of you. You want to pull them around the corner between the two pillars at the beginning of the room. Take them out as fast as you can. Once it\'s clear, wait for the Eye and Slip\'kik to pat away again. Have the person who brought the frost oil and thorium widget go right click the broken trap in the center of the hall, then wait for the Eye of Kilrogg to come back. If the boss pats back before the eye back off and let him walk over the trap. He\'ll be frozen in place for the rest of the instance. Now, kill the eye. Go use the shackle key on the goblin to get his cache(which has a good chance of dropping an epic boe pattern but can also drop some really nice bop blue patterns for Tailoring and Leatherworking - must have Gordok Shackle Key, which drops off the ogres in the area)\n\nGetting to the fourth boss: Now hug the wall to the next hallway where there will be two reavers. You can sheep the far one to pull the close one and fight him back by Slip\'kik(CAREFUL OF AOE) then go into the hall and kill the other one. To the right side of the ramp you\'ll see 2 warlocks and 2 deathguards; take them out and head up the ramp. From here you pull the right side of the platform, and can fight them on the ramp to be sure you don\'t aggro the left side. Head up the next ramp and clear the group immediately on the right(They\'ll aggro as soon as you get to the top of the ramp, yes even at 60) Now head along the wall to the left and take out the two standing astride the doorway. Dogpile into the door and have your rogue open it.\n\nThe fourth boss: In the next room you\'ll find 2 reavers, a doomguard, and a warlock - down them and don\'t move any farther. Have the person who brought the ogre suit use it and go talk to the guard up ahead. He\'ll run off screaming about the prisoners. From here you\'re only 2-3 pulls from the King.',4917,0,'0',0);

Although the mobs there are pickpocket-able, and there are a few \'\'Battered\'\' chests there, the majority of the boxes require 175 to lock pick!

I was out there for awhile, got to 170 from the boxes I pick pocketed from the mobs, but what I should have done is gone to Wetlands!\n\nThe map for Wetlands is a bit deceiving. What you want to do, is go to where the dots are approx. at on the map, and start walking through all of the murlocs.  The lock boxes are scattered around their little huts they have built.  If you are at 160(ish) this is the quickest way to get to 175 without wasting a ton of time pickpocketing for lock boxes that aren\'t even guaranteed to give you a point.\n\nHope this helps some of you!',711264,0,'0',0);

Felwood in general is a great place to farm herbs, it has dreamfoil plaguebloom, gromsblood, and some mountain silversage, All of these herbs tend to be towards end game raids. For example dreamfoil is obviously for Greater Fire Protection potions, and Mountain Silversage is used by many rogues and hunters, or any melee class for that matter. This gives you Mongoose Potions. Gromsblood is used for Flask of the Titans which many new guilds to Bwl end up using once the get to Broodlord. Also a big plus to felwood happens to be the Whipper Roots and Dragon Breaths. Those are very helpful in raids. Those will increase your health and mana. They use to be a 1 min. cooldown, but was changed. There is also a mod called Felwood  Gatherer which shows you were all the spawn points of those are, and once picked gives you a timer.

Thorium is a real metal...\n\nAtomic Number: 90   \nAtomic Radius: 179.8 pm  \nAtomic Symbol:  Th\nAtomic Weight:  232.0381  \nMelting Point: 1750 ?C\nBoiling Point: 4788 ?C \nElectron Configuration:  [Rn]7s26d2\nOxidation States: 4 \n\nWhen pure, thorium is a silvery-white metal which is air-stable and retains its luster for several months. When contaminated with the oxide, thorium slowly tarnishes in air, becoming gray and finally black. The physical properties of thorium are greatly influenced by the degree of contamination with the oxide. The purest specimens often contain several tenths of a percent of the oxide. High-purity thorium has been made. Pure thorium is soft, very ductile, and can be cold-rolled, swaged, and drawn. Thorium is dimorphic, changing at 1400?C from a cubic to a body-centered cubic structure. Thorium oxide has a melting point of 3300?C, which is the highest of all oxides. Only a few elements, such as tungsten, and a few compounds, such as tantalum carbide, have higher melting points. Thorium is slowly attacked by water, but does not dissolve readily in most common acids, except hydrochloric. Powdered thorium metal is often pyrophoric and should be handled carefully. When heated in air, thorium turnings ignite and burn brilliantly with a white light.\n\nTwenty five isotopes of thorium are known with atomic masses ranging from 212 to 236. All are unstable. 232Th occurs naturally and has a half-life of 1.4 x 1010 years. It is an alpha emitter. 232Th goes through six alpha and four beta decay steps before becoming the stable isotope 208Pb. 232Th is sufficiently radioactive to expose a photographic plate in a few hours. Thorium disintegrates with the production of ""thoron"" (220Rn [a form of Radon gas, notice the green clouds around ore nodes), which is an alpha emitter and presents a radiation hazard. Good ventilation of areas where thorium is stored or handled is therefore essential.\n\nyada yada yada so on and so forth... for more info check out http://periodic.lanl.gov/elements/90.html http://periodic.lanl.gov/elements/90.html \nI think its cool when they put a bit of truth into a fictional world :)',274451,0,'0',0);
