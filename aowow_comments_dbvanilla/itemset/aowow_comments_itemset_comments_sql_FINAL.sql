The reason why no one wants shadow priests is because they say. ""Who wants crappy dmg and crappy healing when i could use that spot for good healing OR good damage."" And the reason why they dont have good gear is because they dont have a chance to get good gear. I know a lot of guilds that accept shadow priests, but they dont get anything because the 12 other dps classes in the raid get it because they are a dps class and priests are a healing class.

insert into aowow_comments value (1159,4,525,1159,'2006-09-28 00:00:00','Ohh I forgot to mention, with the BC talents...you would rape as a shadow priest. New spells, less mana cost, and also a HEAL!!! Also, consider the likely chance of there being mind blast rank 10 or even 11, for I did all of my calculations on the rank 9 mind blast. Although the heal costs a lot of mana, most shadow priests have plus dmg AND healing gear, therfore this would not be bad at all. Shadow priests will (hopefully) be more accepted in their raids because they can throw that extra flash heal to party members.\n\nThe biggest thing that I didn\'t mention is that in raids you are doing 15% dmg(shadowform) 15% dmg(shadow weaving) 10% dmg(Darkness) and 15% dmg(curse of shadows: warlock debuff). So thats a total of 55% dmg, which make your mind blasts a 1860 dmg spell NON-CRITICAL!!!!!! (I thought the numbers seemed a little low for the best gear in the game :D)\n\nWith BC you add the 15% crit chance, and also the 3% more dmg (if warlock spec has Malediction) so that means ur doing 1896 dmg on mindblast, and 568 healing to all party members. So im guessing on crits, but I would say 3000 easy? So 1000 healing to party members. I don\'t feal like doing the math for other spells but you get the point...I hope.\n\nThe only thing I would be worried about is running out of mana too fast, (which should not be a problem because of the new BC talents plus raid buffs) and threat. Obviously with that much dmg gear ur gonna get a lot of threat. The reason threat would be a problem is because you can\'t take dps breaks (unless everyone but tank is taking dps breaks example: Onixia) Well, I suppose you could, but you would be letting the 4 people in your group die. So i suggest putting points in your talents to reduce threat. I know you might be giving somethings up, but It would most likely be necissary for a PVE shadow priest. Youe might think that -45% threat is enough, but it might not be. Remember, mind blast ""causes a high amount of threat"". So use fade as often as possible and think about getting a trinket that can reduce your threat. I know of one that can reduce threat by 70% for 20 seconds and that would be VERY usefull for the last 5%-10% of a boss in major raid dungeons. I don\'t think it would be necissary, but it would obviously help.\n\nREMEMBER: All of the calculations that I did were from the best gear in the game. So dont get your hopes up too high unless you are in a guild that accepts shadow priests, the guild raids for 8 hours a day, AND you go to all of the raids are necissary things to aquire such awsome dps/hps. The gear includes all epics, the new legendary staff, and best possible enchants.\n\nAnd for those who say shadowpriests are overpowered, well they are, and thats what I like the most about this class/spec. And for those who say if you want to dps, then change to a dps class. Well, I dont want to do just dps, and I dont want do do just healing. I want to do both, and the only class that can dps and heal at the same time is a shadow spec priest. I suppose you could say warlocks do that, but sipphon life and drain health are just too weak. I like the fact that my healing relys on a f*** load of dmg and it heals your party too.\n\nWell, I think I pretty much proved everyone wrong about shadow priests. And if you have any objections post a comment so I can prove you wrong again. (Besides my calculations...if they are worng...its human error) And if you want to be a shadowpriest, raid, and also get the same chance as everyone else to get gear, show this to ur guildmaster.

The 15% increase to damage for shadow is great for high dps fights such as patchwork and huhu and for fight with no agro problems (C\'Thun) but in general warlocks already have to hold back on dps to not pull agro. While having 15% extra damage would mean they can effectively dps for 15% longer you really are wasting a slot in a raid for a minimal buff. \n\nI personally am a fully shadow spec\'d priest sitting at about 450 damage, not too high but nothing to complain about.

Several of the pieces ONLY drop off bosses that are part of the dungeon tier upgrade quest (the belt, the cowl, the gloves, the mantle, the pants, and the robe), and aren\'t guarenteed to drop off any of them.\n\nWhen doing that series, you kill two of about four that specifically drop Ironweave, for a quest item, so on a single pass, it\'s not possible to get all the parts (and it\'s not guarenteed you\'ll get ANY, either way). You do recieve an item at the end of the series that allows you to summon any of the bosses you\'ve killed (or any you\'ve missed) any time you want.\n\nHowever, this does pretty much put a requirement on obtaining the whole set of having at least someone who\'s completed the entire Dungeon Tier series.

Gray items are still vendor trash, but some of what you pick up is needed for later quests for the Virtuous gear.\n\nUtilize your shadowfiend. There\'s a few bosses you\'ll come by on the grind for this gear that will seem impossible for one person.

This will aggro both Drakkisath and the other guard, target Drakkisath and sick your shadowfiend on him. Your pet can tank him long enough for you to be able to kill both of his guards. After the guards are down the boss is a pushover. He won\'t do enough damage to you while you\'re disoriented by his conflagrate (unless your gear is sub-par). \nhttp://DBURLHERE/http://DBURLHERE/?npc=16042 Lord Valthalak  is another fight that is made much easier with the use of your shadowfiend. \n\nBe prepared to do a lot of continent hopping, and to take a lot of flight paths.

Natural shapeshifter is also a must, as you will most likely be shifting often to get out of snares.  Thick hide isn\'t really essential pvp-wise - if you don\'t go for it, nurturing instinct is very nice (the set alone has 121 str, and 85 dmg/heal. This makes the 6sec buff give a total 297 extra healing, or a passive 143ish come the expansion).\n\nImproved leader of the pack is not realyl a pvp talent; it will help in longer fights against paladins and warriors, but doesnt match up to fear/stun resist or an extra 15% dmg to crits.\n\nThis is an alternative, healing oriented build: http://DBURLHERE/?talent=MZxMGsbbZVxIzcq0Lo http://DBURLHERE/?talent=MZxMGsbbZVxIzcq0Lo \n\nbasically a variation on the old 30/21 build; you lose HotW for much more powerful heals.

And before anyone argues that it defeats the point of earning the gear, the L51-60 bracket was destroyed by Death Knights anyway.  In fact, this gear doesn\'t even put you on equal footing; both the Marshal sets and the Death Knight starting gear is item level 70 (Actually the PvP is 71 - 74), however, the death knights also get rings, trinkets, bracers, belt, cloak, neck and a sigil to go with theirs.\n\nThat rant aside; by the time you gain enough honor to purchase these, you\'ll probably be into your early, or even mid 60s.  If you can\'t afford the set the moment you ding 60, then it\'s not going to be worth attempting to purchase for leveling purposes.  I\'ll explain why in a bit.  If you CAN afford the set, whether by hardcore PvPing up to L60, or by funding it with commendations from a main, then the sets ARE worth getting.  The reason is that the moment you hit 60, you may replace a piece or two quickly, but they will greatly speed your questing along from the start.  Trust me, if you go to Outland at L58, hit 60 and equip your set on the spot and continue, you will notice a very DRASTIC difference.\n\nAs to why it\'s not worth it otherwise:  Gems.\n\nSee, when TBC came out people didn\'t replace their PvP sets until L65-66, or even hgher in some cases.  That\'s not going to happen now.  The greatest gems available at the start of TBC were +6.  We now have +12 greens, and +16 blues.  If you\'re a JC, you can afford to EASILY drop some extremely good gems into a L60 blue from HFR with two sockets, and you\'ll have something that has stats to rival the PvP gear -- just on teh gems alone, never minding its base stats.  Even if you\'re not a JC, the WoTLK green +12s make the sockets on these items ridiculously powerful, to the point that, yes, you still can replace half your set by the time you\'re L62.  That\'s why they\'re not worth it anymore, if you\'re planning on slogging through PvP to earn the honor to use them for leveling purposes only.',1055664,0,'0',0);

Then and only then you will be able to use this item set to Transmogrify your gear with. if you have not done this unfortunately you will not be able to do this. \n\nBut, if you go to Are 52 there is a vendor there that may be able to help you.\n\nThe vendor is already explained in these comments a few times so there is no reason to put a link to who he is. \n\nJust scroll down lol\n\nHope this clears up for you why you can\'t TM this gear\n\nAlso here is a full explanation for you from Roraks link \n\n[b]The items out in the world (Marshals, Grand Marshals, High Warlord, etc) that use the level 60 PvP art are un-transmogrifiable (including the item level 115 stuff that shares the name from Burning Crusade).\n\nIn Area 52 a set of vendors has replaced the PvP Vendors who used to live there.

If you meet the criteria log out and back in and you should be able to access the vendor.\n\nThe design intent with the Feat of Strength achievement requirement was specifically to limit these particular art styles to players who earned them through the OG (and relentlessly difficult) PvP honor system, while keeping the door open to reward them to more people in the future.\n\nIn a future patch the items sold by the Area 52 vendors will also be renamed Replica of to be more consistent with the items sold by the Darkmoon Faire  theyre currently exact duplicates of the original items that allow transmogrification, which is obviously a bit confusing.\n\nPotentially related, since hes in the same area, Kezzik the Striker sells inaccessible Season 1 Gladiators, Season 2 Merciless Gladiators, and Season 3 Vengeful Gladiators gear to all players, as the majority of that gear didnt have restrictions.[/b]',1616480,0,'0',0);

A large mana pool only affects how much time your regen has to work before you\'re empty.  Having a wide variety of heals, main-healing classes can make use of high regen and find themselves able to chain heal almost endlessly.

Your different judgments today were that 1 move at the time which changed depending on your seal active.  If you wanted to judge wisdom, you must have the seal of wisdom up, so on and so forth for each judge.  Seals, however, were only 30 secs long (much unlike the 30 min we have in current Wrath era).  Following a Judge however you would have to reapply your seal as each judge would consume the active seal.  When you see librams like http://DBURLHERE/?item=23203 this  (changed in cataclysm, used to reduce the mana cost of seals by a fixed amount) it actually wasn\'t a joke or filler slot. That mattered to maintain your mana supply. \n\nTo continue this was also long, long before anyone had heard of http://DBURLHERE/?spell=35395 Crusader Strike  and no one even dreamed of a paladin getting a http://DBURLHERE/?spell=53385 Whirlwind  ability.  Your damage was your judgement and your auto attack; that was pretty much it.  In addition your Judge scaled directly with your spell power.  This is why other comments talk of holy paladins being able to do so much damage (in a relative sense of course).  Strength was hard to come by for a paladin unless you looked at purely off-set pieces such as blues or independent epics. Drops like http://DBURLHERE/?item=19387 Chromatic boots  were extremely sought-after and coveted by any DPS warrior or paladin.  With no budget wasted on defense, intellect, or spirit, the agility for crit, the 1% hit, this was very well prized indeed by many.\n\nSpell power was a good thing.  With the 5pc set giving you more and the judgement bonus from the 8 piece set increasing your only true blue offensive ability, this set was indeed both beautiful and very powerful.\n\nEdit: Updated and corrected the Libram for Cataclysm and adjusted the misnomer of Seal duration and consumption (Thank you Riddel)',1036691,0,'0',0);

Personally, I only use the gloves, the boots, and the chest because my guild was able to supplement me with some better +healing gear, but I am looking at obtaining the whole set, if for nothing else than to say, ""Hey, I got it all.""  But in all fairness, this set isn\'t the greatest thing since sliced bread.  I has some downsides which, I hate to admit, are a little pricey.  Druids are mostly called upon to be healers, but this set focuses more on the balance between a balance druid and a healing druid.  Tier two is a much better choice for those druids who are straight up healers in raids and the such.\n\nHowever, there are many pros to this set as well.  It has decent mp5, which can make or break a healer in a raid, above average stats, which is very nice because the more mana you have, the more healing you can throw on the tank, and some nice set bonuses (in all fairness, the tranquility and hurricane cooldowns aren\'t the best ability, but traq has saved my groups more than once).\n\nWhat I\'m trying to get at is that this set while having both negative and positive impacts, is a very good set for those druids who are trying to get the feel for how their class runs through end-game material.',14346,0,'0',0);

When I was doing MC with some friends, a healing druid picked up a piece of the set just for fun, but pretty soon we started discussing the 3-piece set bonus and how it can still be useful.\n\nThe 3-piece bonus can essentially (ab)used just for buffing raid members. After buffing you can switch back to your shiny BC raiding gear and still get the benefit of 15min buffs that do a little bit more damage than usual. Note that the damage increase is amplified by the druid talent http://DBURLHERE/?spell=16840 Brambles , bringing http://DBURLHERE/?spell=26992 Thorns  damage up from ~44 (already talented) to ~51. While it might not seem a lot, this can be helpful in endgame raiding, for example on Hyjal trash increasing your tanks threat by a bit.\n\nThere is something interesting to note about a peculiarity when the druid uses the items just for buffing and then switches to higher quality gear. It seems the additional damage is not applied in this case if the druid himself is hit by a mob. However the additional buff duration is retained and further testing revealed that the additional damage also remains in place when other people are buffed with it and then hit by mobs, even if the druid then switches gear. Seems like Blizzard intended to remove the damage bonus if the set is not equipped, but poorly implemented it, which can be exploited to a minor advantage.\n\nA quick lookup of other old tier-sets revealed that there is no other set-bonus that can be exploited in a similiar fashion, though I might be wrong on that one and overlooked something.',308702,0,'0',0);

NOTE: This is assuming you are a high-level paladin, warrior, hunter, shaman, whatever that can use mail armor that has the time for farming all of this.  I did, and I ended up with a fine set, but you might not have the patience.  If you do, happy hunting.\n\nHead: My choice was http://DBURLHERE/?item=18817"">(Item #18817) , but you can choose what you wish.  It drops from Ragnaros in MC40 for a 14% drop chance.  One of the more difficult pieces to aquire, but it looks very good with the set.\n\nShoulders: http://DBURLHERE/?item=31160"">(Item #31160) .  They drop from Morcrush in Outlands (more specifically Blade\'s Edge Mts.) for a somewhat-tough 1/5 (specifically 22%) drop chance.\n\nBack: http://DBURLHERE/?item=17107"">(Item #17107) .  Matches the Tabard almost perfectly, and like the Crown of Destruction, it drops from Ragnaros.  Like Crown of Destruction, it is also one of the more difficult to aquire in this set, with a drop rate of only 13%.\n\nChest: http://DBURLHERE/?item=30947"">(Item #30947) .  A fine looking chestpiece that matches the shoulders perfectly.  Rewarded from a chain quest in the Outlands.\n\nShirt: I recommend a red shirt.  I chose http://DBURLHERE/?item=2575"">(Item #2575) , but any red shirt will do.  Just get it from the AH or from a tailor.\n\nTabard: http://DBURLHERE/?item=23192"">(Item #23192) , because, well, it\'s the Scarlet Crusade\'s tabard.  Need I say more? It has a 3% drop rate off Scarlet Trainees, which spawn right after Herod\'s death.  Should be easy to get, since around 20 of them spawn at a time.  EDIT: No longer drops.  Saddening, but perhaps you could have your guild make a mock-up of it for their tabards?\n\nWrists: The original set was wiped out, and so far, I cannot find decent mail wrists to match.\n\nHands: This item was wiped out, and so far, I cannot find decent mail hands to match.\n\nWaist: The original set was wiped out, and so far, I cannot find decent mail waist to match.\n\nLegs: The original set was wiped out, and so far, I cannot find decent mail legs to match.\n\nFeet: http://DBURLHERE/?item=10155"">(Item #10155) .  A very tough piece to get, with a 1.2% max drop rate from the Dreadlords in the Blasted Lands, and 0.something% for other mobs across Azeroth.  Best bet is to go to the Blasted Lands, set up camp, and farm those Dreadlords like there\'s no tomorrow.\n\nWeapon: http://DBURLHERE/?item=28749"">(Item #28749) .  A little clunky looking (I prefer sleek and swift-looking swords IMHO), but hey, it seems to fit with the rest of the set, and it gets points for practicality since I am a Protadin, and this appears to be, from my judgement, a tanking weapon.  Drops for a 16% chance from the chess game reward chest in Karazhan.\n\nShield: http://DBURLHERE/?item=14954"">(Item #14954) . A look-alike of the now-unobtainable http://DBURLHERE/?item=7726"">(Item #7726) , and it\'s just so fricking obvious why you should get this for your set.  I mean, the Scarlet logo is on the shield itself!  It can\'t be more obvious!  It\'s one of those famous world drops, so basically farm whatever you can in the level range of 45-55.\n\nIf anyone has a better substitute for any of the pieces, please notify me by emailing me or simply replying to this comment.  Good luck, and may the Light guide you to the end of the Undead Menace :)\n\nEdit: Updated with the removal of the Scarlet Chainmail set in-game.

Feel free to visit it and give me many many stars. =PQuite a few people have suggested various substitutions for the Scarlet set, due to the following problems:\n\n1) The boots and chest have a very low drop rate, making them hard to find and often prohibitively expensive.\n2) There\'s no ""official"" helm or shoulders to go with the set.\n\nI\'ve made an attempt at a comprehensive list of the viable solutions.  I\'ll add any others that come to my attention.  \n\n[u][b]Chest[/b][/u]:  This is by far the easiest piece to cover for, because the http://DBURLHERE/?item=23192"">(Item #23192)  is both easy to obtain and an obvious part of the set.  All you want, then, is an AH green that doesn\'t have visible arms that look out of place in the set.  You can do this on your own AH, probably for less than 10g.  If you\'re using a chest with no visible arms, I highly recommend one of the 3 red shirts in the notes below as well.  \n\n[u][b]Boots[/b][/u]:  There are several workable boots that can stand in until that magic day when http://DBURLHERE/?item=10332"" class=""qundefined icontiny"" style=""background-image: url(images/icons/tiny/inv_boots_02.gif)"">Scarlet Boots  appear.  However, most of your boot options pick up the red/chain look of the leggings rather than matching the red/gold of the actual scarlet boots.[ul][li]My favorite option is http://DBURLHERE/?item=31173"">(Item #31173) . Even better, Horde can get an identical pair, http://DBURLHERE/?item=29313"">(Item #29313) , from a quest in Auchenai Crypts.  Alliance will be stuck watching the AH, though... suckers![/li][li]?item=11627"">(Item #11627) /?item=18047"">(Item #18047)  are a good alternative to the Boots of Savagery, from BRD/BRS respectively.[/li][li]?item=9784"">(Item #9784) /?item=24855"">(Item #24855)  aren\'t bad, but I don\'t like them as much as the above options. They\'re shorter and leave a gap on female toons btwn the bottom of the leggings and the top of the boots.[/li][li]If you want a narrower boot, http://DBURLHERE/?item=56695"">(Item #56695) /?item=30958"">(Item #30958)  are quest items that match the Scarlet art.[/li][li]Finally, http://DBURLHERE/?item=9387"">(Item #9387)  are easily farmable from first boss in Uldaman.

It looks amazing with the set, but it\'s a BS crafted item with an extremely rare vanilla  pattern.  Expect to troll trade for quite a while to find someone who can craft this.

The red whelp gloves actually give a proc that\'s equivalent to 1-1.3 dps per minute with 1.5-1.9 speed daggers, the equivalent to about 14-20 AP. Being a 5% chance to proc, though, and the fact that a ton of rogues use shadowfang/cruel barb at this level, (and with shadowfang\'s relatively slow speed for a 1h), no one really uses the red whelp gloves.\nand lastly http://DBURLHERE/?item=10400 http://DBURLHERE/?item=10400  vs. http://DBURLHERE/?item=5961 http://DBURLHERE/?item=5961  you lose 2 AP and 5 agi worth of dodge.\n\nThe set bonuses, however, make up for this by the expertise and AP bonuses.\n\nThe arcane resistance offers a slight buff to resisting polymorph, which is nice, but not dependable enough to be consequential unless stacked with more. The armor makes up for a little bit of lost agi, but again, it\'s not that great a bonus.\n\nFrom typical twink gear, you\'re going to be down about 100-200 hp or 4-8 AP, (depending on what you pick) you\'ll also lose around 10% dodge from the agi. In return, YOUR attacks will gain about 0.95% chance to not miss, not be dodged, not be blocked, and not be parried. for warriors, pallies, shammies, and pets, that\'s 3.8% more on the table. for hunters and rogues that\'s 1.9% more.
