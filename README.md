Comments for AOWOW

/htmlfix contains the same comment sql but with html code changed to BB code i.e. < i > is replaced with [i]

Search & Replace each comment SQL for http://DBURLHERE/ and replace this string with the URL of your DB website, i.e. http://www.mysuperdbhere.com/

If you intend to use this with a "public" website, go into each account sql file and search replace changepass1234 to something only you know i.e. something random. Else users of your website can login as any account.

The rating sql file contains ratings for each comment, they are a bit higher than the original i.e. instead of a +10 it might be +20, I have not bothered to fix this.
